JOSEPH RODMAN DRAKE.

THE AMERIGAN FLAG.

HEN Freedom, from her mountain Ι
height, ”
Unfurled her standard to the air,
She tore the azure robe of night,
And set the stars of glory there!
She mingled with its 8111800113 dyes
The milky baldric of the skies,
And striped its pure celestial white ¹
wit-1. streakings of the morning light,
Then, from his mansion in the 31111,
8110 called her eagle-bearer down,
And gave into his mighty hand
The symbol of her 01103011 land!

Majestic monarch of the cloud 1
tho rear’st aloft thy regal form,
To 11031· 1110 tempest-trumpings lond,
And see the lightning lances driven,
then strive the warriors of the 3101111,
And rolls the thunder-drum of heaven,—
Child of the 811111 10 11100 ’1 13 given
To guard 1110 banner of the free,
To hover in the sulphur smoke,
To ward away the battle-stroke,
And bid its blendings shine afar,
Like rainbows on the cloud of war,
The harbingers of victory 1

 

Flag of the brave 1 thy folds shall fly,
The sign of hope and triumph high !
When speaks the signal-trumpet tone,
And the long line 0011103 gleaming 011,
Ere yet the life-blood, Warln 31111 11101,
Has dimmed the glistening bayonet‚

Each soldier's eye shall brightly turn
To where the sky-born glories burn,
And, as his springing steps advance,
Catch war and vengeance from the glanno.
And when the cannon-1nout5ings lond
Heave 111 wild wreaths the battle shrond,
And gory sabres 1130 and fall
Like 3110013 of flame on midnight‘s pall,
Then shall thy meteor glauces glow‚

And cowering foes shall shrink beneath
Each gallant arm that strikes below

That lovely messenger of death.

Flag of the seas! 011 ocean wave

Thy stars shall glitter o'er the brave:
When death, careering on the gale,
Sweeps darkly round the bellied sail,
And frighted waves rush wildly back
Before the broadside’s reeling rack,
Each dying wanderer of the sea

811311 look at once to heaven and thee,
And smile to see thy splendors fly

In triumph o'er his closing eye.

Flag of the free heart's hope and home,
By angel hands to valor given,
Thy stars have lit the welkin dome,
And all thy 111103 were born in heaven.
Forever ssoat that standard sheet!
VVhere breathes the foe but falls before
us,
With Freedom’s 3011 1101103111 our feet,
And Freedom’s banner streaming o’er
us 1

THE STURGEON.
111οΜ “THE CULPRIT FAY.”

NWARD still he held his way,
T ill he came where the column of
moonshine lay,

And saw beneath the snrface dim
The brown-backed sturgeon slowly swim :
Around him were the gohlin train—
But he soulled with all his might and main,
And followed wherever the sturgeon led,
Till he saw him upward point his head ;
Then 110 dropped his paddle-blade,

And held his colen-goblet up
To catch the drop in its crimson cup.

With sweeping tail and quivering fin,
Through the wave the sturgeon flew,
And, like the heaven-shot javelin‚
He sprang above the waters blue,

Instant as the star-fall light,
He plunged him 111 1110 deep again,
