WASHINGTON IRVING.

Ν ay, don't be embarrassed, nor look so beseeching‚

I shan't run directly against my own preaching‚

And having just laughed at their Raphaels and Dantes,
Go to setting you up beside matchless Cervantes;

But allow me to speak what I honestly feel,

To a true poet-beart add the fun of Dick Steele,

Throw in‘all of Addison‚ minus the chill,

With the whole of that partnership's stock and good-will,
Mix well, and while stirring, hum o'er, as a spell,

Tlxe ‘⁴ fine old English Gentleman‚'’ simmer it well,
Sweeten just to your own private liking, then stram,
That only the finest and clearest remain.

Let it stand out of doors till a soul it receives

From the warm lazy sun loitering down through green leaves,
And you'll find a choice nature not wholly deserving

A name either English or Yankee--just Irving.

THE ALHAMBRA

HE moon, which then was invisible, has
gradually gained upon the nights‚ and
now rolls in full splendor above the

towers, pouring a flood of tempered light into
every court and hall. The garden beneath
my window is gently lighted up, the orange
and citron trees are tipped with silver, the
fountain sparkles in the moonbeams, and even
the blush of the rose is faintly visible.

I have sat for hours at my window inhaling
the sweetness of the gurden, and musing on the
checkered features of those whose history is
dimly shadowed out in the elegant memorials
around. Sometimes Ι have issued forth at
midnight when every thing was quiet, and
have wandered over the whole building.
tho can do justice to a moonlight night in
such a climate and in such a place? The
temperature of an Andalusian midnight, in
summer, is perfectly ethereal. We seem lifted
up into a purer atmosphere3 there is aserenity
of soul, a buoyancy of spirits, an elasticity of
frame, that render mere existence enjoyment.

The effect of moonlight, too, on the Alham-
bra has something like enchantment. Every
rent and chasm of time, every mouldering tint
and weather-stain, disappears, the marble re-
sumes its original whiteness, the long colon-
nades brighten in the moonbeams, the halls
are illuminated with a softened radiancc, until
the whole edifice reminds one of the enchanted

palaee of an Arabian tale. At such time I have
ascended to the little pavilion, called the
Queen’s Toilette, to enjoy its varied and exten-
sive prospect. To the right, the snowy summits
of the Sierra N evada would gleam like silver
clouds against the darker firmament, and all ¹
the outlines of the mountain would be sost-
ened, yet delicately defined. My delight,
however, would be to lean over the parapet
of the tocador, and gaze down upon Granada,
spread out like a map below me, all buried ’
in deep repose, and its white palaces and con-
vents sleeping as it were in the moonshine. 3:
Sometimes Ι would hear the faint sounds of Q
castanets from some party of dancers lingering f
in the Alameda; at other times I have heard J
the dubious tones of a guitar, and the notes of
a single voice rising from some solitary street, j
and have pictured to myself some youthful ἶ.

Such are the soenes that have detained me ’ὲ
for many an hour loitering about the courts -’ 1
