448 FAVORITE POEMS AND PROSE SELECTIONS.

Ah, who beneath that cloudless sky, Ι While at the stern the dreadful 11311165-
That smiling bends serene, Above the deck appear.

Could dream that danger, awful, vast,
Impended o’er the scene—

Could dream that ere an honr had sped,
That frame of sturdy oak

Would sink beneath the lake’s blue waves‚
Blackened with fire and smoke?

John Maynard watched the nearing flames,
But still, with steady hand

He grasped the wheel‚ and steadfastly
He steered the ship to land.

“ John Maynard,'' with 311 anxious voice,
The captain cries once more,

A seaman sought the captain's side, “ Stand by the wheel five minutes yet,
A moment whis'pered low ; And we will reach the shore.”

The captain‘s swarthy face grew pale, Through flames and smoke that dauntlesshear-t.
He hurried down below. Responded firmly, still

Alas, too late! Though quick and sharp Ullstwe‘l, though face tO faoe With deal-h,
And clear his order came, “ With God’s good help I will l ''

No human effort could avail

ΤΟ queneh the insidious flame- The flames approached with giant strides,

They scorch his hands and brow ·

The bad news quickly reached the deck, One arm disabled seeks his side
It sped from lip to lip, Ah, he is conquered now 1

And ghastly faces everywhere But no, hiS teeth are firmly Set,
Looked from the doomed ship. ΗΘ crushes down the pain—

“ Is there no hope—no chance of life? His knee upon the stanchion pressed‚
Α hundred lips implore ; He guides the ship again.

“ But one,'’ the captain made reply,

u TO run the Ship on shore.’' One moment yet 1 one moment yet!

Brave heart, thy task is o’er!

A sailor‚ whose heroic soul The pebbles grate beneath the keel,
That hour should yet reveal— The stealner touches shore.

By name John Maynard, eastern horn— Three hundred grateful voices rise,
Stoodly calmly at the wheel. 1¹1 Praise ῒΟ God, that He ⁴

“ Head her southeast 1 '’ the captain shouts Hath saved them from the fearful fire,
Above the smothered roar, And from the ingulfing sea.

“ Head her southeast without delay l

Make for the nearest shore 3 „ But where is he, that helmsman bold?

The captain saw him reel—

No terror pales the helmsman’s cheek, His nerveless hands released their task,
Or clouds his dauntless eye, He sunk beside the wheel.

As in a sailor's measured tone The wave received his lifeless corpse,
His voice responds, “Ay, Ay 1 ” Blackened with smoke and fire.

Three hundred souls—the steamer's freight— God rest him 1 Hero never had
Crowd forward wild with fear, A nobler funeral pyre!

 

THE SONG OF THE PRAIRIE.
ΒΥ 1. K. MrrcHELL.

FLY to the prairie‚ sweet lnaiden, with The city's a prison too narrow for thee—

me, [the sea: Then away to the prairies so boundles and ⁹
'Tis as green and as wide and as wild as free: ·
O’er its soft silkeu bosom the summer winds XVhere the sight is not checked till the prairie
glide, and skies,

And wave the wild grass in its hillowy pride. Iu harmony blending, commingle their dyeS.
