THOMAS DUNN ENGLISH.

J OHNNY BARTHOLOMEW.

THE journals this morning are full of a And the volume of smoke as it gathered and

tale

rolled‚

Osa terriblcridc throughatunnel by rail; Shook fearful dismay from each dun-colored

And people arc called 011 to note and adinirc
How a hundred or more, through the 31110116-

cloud and lire,
lVere borne from all peril to limbs and to

lives-—

Mothers saved to their children, and hushands ,

to wives,
But of him who performed such a notable

dced
Quite little thc journalist gives us to read.
In truth, of this hero 30 plucky and bold,
There is nothing except, in few syllables told,
His name, which is ‚Johnny Bartholomew.

Away in N evada—they ‹lon‘t tell 113 where,

Nor does it much matter—a railway is there,

Which winds in and out through the cloven
ravines,

With gliinpses at times of the wildest of
scenes—

Now passing a bridgc seeming fine as a thread,

Now shooting past cliss‘s that iinpend o‘er the

head,

Now plunging some black—throated tunnel
within,

whose darkness is roused at the clatter and
din ;

And ran every day with its train o'er the read,
An engine that steadily d ragged on its load,
And was driven by Johnny Bartholomew.

With throttle-valvc down, hc was slowing the
train,

While the sparks fell around and behind him
like rain,

As he came to a spot where a curve to the
right

Brought tho blac-k, yawning mouth of a tun-
nel in sight,

And peering ahcad with a far-seeing ken,

Felt a quick sense of danger come over him
then.

lVas a train on the traek‘? No! A peril as
dire—-

The further extreme of the tumui 011 lire!

But (floaerlgiited not Johnny Bartholomew.

Beat faster his heart, though its current stood
still,

And 1113 nerves felt a jar but no tremulous thrill

And his eyes keenly gleamed through their
partly closed lashes,

And his lips--not with fear—took the color
of ashes,

If we salter, these people behind 113 are dead!

So close the doors, flreman—we’ll send her
abead !

Crowd on the steam till she rattles and swings!

Opeu the throttle-valve l Give her her wings !'’

Shouted he from 1113 post in the engineer’s room,

Driving onward perchance to aterrible doom,

This man they call J ohnny BartholOmew.

Firm grasping the bell-rope and holding his
on, onbrt‘iirtciiigh the vale of the shadow

of Death,
On, 011 through that horrible cavern of hell,
Thr-ough flames that arose and through
timbers that fell,
Through the eddying smoke and the serpents
That wiiitlfigd and that hissed in their anguish
With 1183111111ιὲ1ιά a roar like a wild tempest's
To thebas} air beyond them in safety they
1
Whne iffisecidng of the ben and the steam
pipe's shrill yell,
Told the joy at escape from that underground

Of the 1111111 they called Johnny Bartholomew.

Did the passengers get up a service of plate?
Did some oily-tongued orator at the man

1170111611113ΞΞ istm? Young children cling fast

to his knees‘?
