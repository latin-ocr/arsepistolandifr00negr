472 ALFRED TENNYSON.

THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER.
T is the miller's daughter, In sorrow and in rest:
Ι And she is grown so dear, so dear, And I should know if it beat right,
That I would be the jewel I'd clasp it round so close and tight.

That trembles at her ear :
For, hid in ringlets day and night,
I'd 1‹›u‹·h her neck so warni and white.

And I would be the necklace,
And all day long to fall and rise
Upon her balmy bosom,

And l would be the girdle With her laughter 0r her sighs:
About her ‹lainty, dainty waist‚ And Ι would lie so light, so light,
And her beart would beat against 1ne I scarce should be unelasped at night.

BREAK, BREAK, BREAK.

REAK, break, break, And the stately ships go on,
Β ()11 thy cold gray mones, O sea! To the haven under the hill;
And I would that my tongue could utter But, O for the touch of a vanished hand 3
The thoughts that arise in me. And the sound of a voice that is still!
O well for the fishernlan’s boy, Break‚ break, break, ⁷
'l'hat he shouts with his sister at play! At the foot of thy crags, O sea J
(1) well sor the sailor lad But the tender grace of a day that is dead
T hat- he sings in his boat on the hay 1 Will never come back to me.

GROSSING· THE BAR.

The following was the last poem of the celebrated author. I t was sung at his funeral.

UNSET and evening star, Twilight and evening bell,
S And one clear call for me ; And aster that the dark;
And may there be no lnoaning of the bar And may thero be no sadness of farewell
then I put out to sea. When I embark 3
But such a tide as nioving seems asleep, For, though from out our bourne of time and
Τωυ sull sor sound and foam, place,
XVhen that which drew from out the boundless The flood may bear me far,
‹hwp I hope to seo my Pilot face to face

'rm-ns again home. then I have erosscd the bar.
