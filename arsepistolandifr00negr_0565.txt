land. His most elaborate work is ‘ Lalla Rookh‚' for which he received
315000. This poem has been one of the most popular written by any
modern author. Various other works in prose and poetry were well
received. His best productions, however, are his lyrics, love songs breath-
ing the most ardent passion, many of which are familiar to the general
public. As a graceful versifier and writer of poetry which has the ring
of perpetual music in it, Moore is unexcelled. He was a great social
favorite, enjoying the friendship of Byron and other celebrities.''

 

’TIS THE LAST ROSE OF SUMMER.

7 Ι8 the last rose of summer Thus kindly Ι scatter

Left blooming alone ; Thy leaves o'er the bed
All her lovely companions Where- thy mates of the garden
Are faded and gone 3 Lie scentless and dead.
No flower of her kindred‚
No rosebud is nigh‚ 80 soon may I follow,
To reflect back her blushes, thell friendshiP'S dssss‘dy,
Or give sigh for sigh 1 Α11(1 from love's shining circle
The genis drop away!
I’ll not leave thee, thou lone one, then true hearts lie withered,
To pine 011 the stem ; And fond ones are flown,
Since the lovely are sleeping, Oh 1 who would inhabit
Go, sleep thou with them. This bleak world alone?

 

WHEN FIRST Ι ΜΕΤ ΤΗΕΕ.

ΗΕΝ first I met thee, warm and young, The heart that now thy falsehood rends
There shone such truth about thee, Would then have bled to right thee.

And on thy lip such promise hung, But go, deceiver! go—
1 did not dare to doubt thee. Some day, perhaps, thou'lt waken
I saw thee change, yet still relied, From pleasure’s dream, to know
Still clung with hope the fonder, The grief of hearts forsaken.

And thought, though false to all beside,
From me thou could’st not wander.
But go, deceiver! go ε
The heart, whose hopes could make it
Trust one so false, so low,
Deserves that thou shouldst break it.

E’en now, though youth its bloom has shed,
No lights of age adorn thee :

The few who loved thee once, have fled,
And they who flatter, scorn thee.

Thy midnight cup is pledged to slaves,
No genial ties enwreathe it;

*WVhen every tongue thy follies named, The smiling there, like light 011 graves,
Ι fied the unwelcome story 3 Has rank cold hearts beneath it.
Or found, in e'en the faults they blamed, Go—-go—though worlds were thine,
Some gleams of future glory. I would not now surrender
Ι still was true, when nearer friends One taintless tear of mine

Conspired to wrong, to slight thee3 For all thy guilty splendor!
