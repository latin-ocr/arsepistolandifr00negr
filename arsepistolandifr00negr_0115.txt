BAYARD TAYLOR. 85

Longfellow‚ and Mrs. Stowe3 they are delightful and refreshing reading,
crowded with life-like characters, full of delicate and subtle sympathies‚
with ideas the most opposite to his own, and lighted up throughout with
that playful humor which suggests always wisdom rather than mere fun3
they are a great rest after the crowded artistic effects and the conventional
interests of even the better kinds of English novels.

The characteristics of Mr. Taylor's writings are, in his poema, ease
of expression, with a careful selection of poetical capabilities, a full, ani-
mated style, with a growing attention to art and condensation. His prose
is equable and clear, in the flowing style, the narrative of a genial, healthy
observer of the many manners of the world which he saw in the most
remarkable portions of the four quarters.

Mr. Taylor was twice married, the second time in Germany. In 1877
he was appointed by President Hayes United States Minister to Berlin,
and while serving in this capacity died December 19th, 1878.

 

PROPOSAL.

HE violet loves a sunny bank,
The cowslip loves the lea,
The scarlet creeper loves the elm,

And Ι love thee.

The west winds kiss the clover blooms,
But I kiss thee.

The oriole weds his mottled mate,
The lily's bride o’ the bee,
Heaven's marriage ring is round the earth,

Shall Ι wed thee?

The sunshine kisses mount and vale,
The stars they kiss the sea,

 

OHRISTMAS IN GERMANY.

shouting and seeking out toys from the
booths, and talking all the time of the Christ-
mas that was so near. The poor people went
by with their little presente hid under their
cloaks‚ lest their children might see them3
every heart was glad and every countenance
v wore a smile of secret pleasure.

Finally the day before Christmas arrived.
The streets were so full I could scarce make
my way through, and the sale of trees went
*on more rapidly than ever. These were com-
monly branches of pine or fir, set upright in
a little miniature garden of 111055. When the

lamps were lighted at night, our street had
the appearance ofan illuminated garden. We
were prohibited from entering the rooms up·
stairs in which the grand ceremony was to
take place, being obliged to take our seats in
those arranged for the guests, and wait with
impatience the hour when Christ-kindchen
should 6311. Several relations of the family
came, and what was more agreeable‚ they
brought with them five or six children. Ι
was anxious to see how they would view the
ceremony.

Finally, in the middle of an interesting
conversation, we heard the bell ringing up-
stairs. We 311 started up, and made for the
