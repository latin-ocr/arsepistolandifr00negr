WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE. ’ 535

Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,

Ι should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,

Who, you all know, are honorable men :

Ι will not do them wrong; I rather choose

To wrong the dead, to wrong myself, and you,

Than I will wrong such houm-able men.

But here’s a parchment, with the seal of
Caesar,—

I found it in his closet,—’tis his will:

Let but the commons hear his testament,

(Which, pardon me, Ι do not mean to read),

And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s
wounds,

And dip their napkins in his sacred blood ;

Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,

And, dying, mention it within their wills,

Bequeathing it, as a rich legacy‚

Unto their issue.

You all do know this mantle: Ι remember

The first time ever Caesar put it on ;

'Twas on a summer‘s evening, in his tent ;

That day he overcame the Nervii :—

Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:

See what a rent the envious Casca made :

Through this the well—beloved Brutus stabbed ;

And, as he plucked his cursed steel away,

Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it,

As rushing out of doors, to be resolved

If Brutus so unkindly knocked‚ or no ;

For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:

J udge, O you gods how dearly Caesar loved
him!

This was the most unkindest cut of all ;

For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,

In gratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms,

Quite vanquished him ε then burst his might-y
heart ;

And, in his mantle muffling up his face,

 

 

Even at the base of Pompey’s statue,

Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.

O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!

Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,

Whilst bloody treason flourished over us.

O, now you weep ; and, I perceive, you feel

The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.

Kind souls, what, weep you when you but
behold

Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,

Here is himself, marred, as you see, with
traitors.

Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir

you up

To such a sudden flood of mutiny.

They that have done this deed are honorable ;-

What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,

That made them do it ;-—they are wise and
honorable,

And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you,

I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts;

Ι am no orator as Brutus is ;

But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,

That love my friend; and that they know
full well

That gave me public leave to speak of him:

For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,

Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,

To stir men’s blood : I only speak right on:

I tell you that which you yourselves do know;

Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor, poor
dumb mouths,

And bid them speak for me: but were I
Brutus,

And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony

Would ruffle up yonr spirits, and put a tongue

In every wound of Caesar, that should move

The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.

 

A DAGGER ΟΕ· THE MIND.
FROM “MACBETH.”

Macbeth before the murder of Duncan, meditating alone, sees the image of a dagger in

⁷ the air, and thus soliloquizes :

S this a dagger which I see before me,
The handle toward my hand ⁶?
let me clutch thee :—
Ι have thee not, and yet Ι 366 thee still.
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible

To feeling as to sight? or art thou but

Come, A dagger of the mind, a false creation,

Proceeding from the beat-oppressed brain?
Ι see thee yet, in form as palpable
As this which now I draw.
