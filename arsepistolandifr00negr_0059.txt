WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT. 39

See, love, my boat is moored for 11166, then crimson sky and flamy cloud
By ocean’s weedy 11001- Bespeak the summer o’er‚

The petrel does not skim the sea And the dead valleys wear a shroud
More swiftly than my oar. Of snows that melt no more,

We’ll go, where, on the rocky isles, I’ll build of ice thy winter home,

Her eggs the screatning sea-fowl piles With glistening walls and glassy dome,
Beside the pebbly shore. And spread with skins the floor.

Or, bide thou where the poppy blows, The white 1οΧ by thy couch shall play;
With wind-flowers frail and fair, And, from the frozen skies‚

While Ι, upon his isle of snows, The meteors of a inimic day
Seek and defy the bear, 811311 113511 upon thine eyes,

Fierce though he be, and huge of frame, And I-—for such thy vow-—meanwhile

This arm his savage strength shall tame. 811 all hear thy voice and see thy smile‚

¹ And drag him from his lair. Ti l that long midnight flies.

 

 

FAIREST OF THE RURAL MAIDS.

H, fairest of the rural muids! Thy step is as the wind, that weaves
Thy birth was in the forest shades ; Its playful way among the leaves.
Green boughs and glimpses of the sky

urere all that met thy ius-ant eye· Thine eyes are springs in whose serene

And silent waters heaven is seen,

Thy sports, thy wanderings‚ when a child, ψ Their lashes are the herbs that look
Were ever in the sylvan wild ; On their young figures in the brook.
And all the beauty of the place

IS jn thy beart and on thy face· The forest depths, by foot unpresscd,

Are not 111016 51111655 111311 thy breast ;
The twilight of 1116 trees and rocks The holy peace that fills the air
Is in the light shade of thy looks : Of those calm solitudes is there.

 

 

THE: PLANTING OF THE APPLE-TREE.

OME, let us plant the apple-tree. What plant we in this apple—tree‘?
Cleave the tough greensward 111111 1116 ζ 81176615 for a hundred flowery springs
spade ; To load the May-wind’s restless wings,
Wide let its hollow bed be 1113(16; then, from the orchard row, he pours
There gently lay the roots, and there Its fragrance through our open doors;
Sift the dark mould with kindly care, ἵ A world of blossoms for the hee,

And press it o’er them tenderly‚ Flowers for the sick girl's silent room,
As round the tender infant’s feet For the glad infant sprigs of bloom
We softly fold the cradle›sheet; We plant with the apple-tree.

So plant we the apple-tree.

What plant we in this apple-tree? What plant we in this apple-tree?
Buds which the breath of summer days Fruits that shall swell in merry June,
Shall lengthen into leafy sprays ; And redden in the August noon,
Boughs where the thrush with 6111115011 breast ¹ And drop, when gentle 3115 come by
811311 haunt, and sing, and hide her nest; That fan the blue September sky,

We plant, upon the sunny lea, While children come, with cries of glee,
A shadow for the noontide 110111, Α11(1 seek them where the fragrant grass
A shelter from the summer-'S shower, Betrays their bed to those who pass,

 

When we plant the apple-trec. = At the foot of the apple-tree.
