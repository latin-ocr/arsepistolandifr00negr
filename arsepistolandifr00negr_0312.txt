264 FRANCEs E. WILLARD.

advantages furnished by travel and contact with the world, she spent two
years abroad, and then returned to become Professor of AEsthetics in
Northwestern University and Dean of the WVoman‘s College. This posi-
tion she filled from 1871 to 1874, and there developed her system of self-
government, which has attracted wide attention and has been adopted by
other educatorS. She became convinced at this time that there was a
work for her to do in connection with the cause of Temperance.

In consequence of this decision she gave up all other engagements
in 1874 to identify herself with the Woman’s Christian Temperance
Union. She was immediately made corresponding secretary‚ discharging
the duties of this office until 1879, when she was elevated from the posi-
tion of secretary to that of president.

In 1876 she assisted Dwight L. Moody in his evangelistic work and
rendered efficient service. During these years she traveled through the
country, addressing legislatures and people’s meetings in behalf of tem-
perance and prohibition. She organized the Home Protection Movement

and sent an appeal from nearly two hundred thousand people to the Leg—
islature of Illinois, asking for the Temperance ballot for women. She

was always of the opinion that the great reforms needed in America
would never be brought about until women were permitted to vote, having*
a voice not merely in domestic affairs, but in public measures for the wel-
fare of the community. Some of her hardest work was done in the
advocacy of this project.

On the death of her brother, Oliver A. Willard‚ in 1879, she suc-
ceeded him as chief editor of the “ Chicago Evening Post,’' but resigned
soon afterward to devote all her time to the work which was dear to her
heart, and in which she had exerted a wide and commanding influence.
In 1886 she accepted the leadership of the White Cross movement in the
societies founded by herself, and obtained enactments in many states for

the protection of women.
In 1888 she was made president of the American branch of the Inter-

national Council of Women and of the World's Christian Union. In
1892 she visited England, and received an enthusiastic welcome from the
friends of reform in that country. She was at the head of the Women's
Committee of Temperance Meetings at the World’s Fair in 1893. She
was the editor of the “ Union Signal,'' a journal of wide circulation‚ and
issued nine volunies, containing addresses and other matter connected
with those reforms in which she was so conspicuous a figure.
