there is thy spirit flown?
Ι gaze above—thy look is imaged there 3
Ι listen—and thy gentle tone
Is on the air.

O, come, while here I press
M y brow upon thy grave; and, in those mild

 

GEORGE DENISON PRENTICE.

And thrilling tones of tenderness,
Bless, bless thy child!

Yes, bless your weeping ehild;
And o'er thine urn—religion’s holiest shrine—
Ο, give his spirit, undefiled,
To blend with thine.

A NAME IN THE SAND.

LONE Ι walked the ocean strand,
A pearly shell was in my hand :
Ι stooped and wrote upon the saud
My name, the year and day :—
As onward from the spot Ι passed,
One lingering look behind I cast—
A wave came rolling high and fast,
And washed my line away.

And so, methought, 't will quickly be
With every mark on earth with me :
A wave of dark oblivion's sea

Will sweep across the place

 

there Ι have trod the sandy shore

Of time, and been to be no more—

Of me, my day, the name Ι bore,
To leave no track or trace.

And yet, with Him who counts the sande,
And holds the water in his hands,
I know a lasting record stands,
Inscribed against my name,
Of all this mortal part has wrought,
Of all this thinking soul has thought,
And from these fleeting moments caught,
For glory or for shame.

 

ΤΟ A LADY.

THINK of thee when morning springs
From sleep‚ with plumage bathed in dew,
And, like a young bird, lifts her wings
Of gladness on the welkin blue.

And when, at noon, the breath of love
O'er flower and stream is wandering free,

And sent in musio from the grove,
I think of thee—I think of thee.

Ι think of thee, when, soft and wide,
The evening spreads her robes of light,

And, like a young and timid bride,
Sits blushing in the arms of night.

And when the moon’s sweet crescent springs
In light o’er heaven's deep, waveless sea,
And stars are forth, like blessed things,
I think of thee—I think of thee.

Ι think of thee 3—that eye of fiame,
Those tresses‚ falling bright and free.

That brow, where “ Beauty writes her name,’'
I think of thee—I think of thee.

HEAVEN OUR HOME.

T cannot be that earth is man’s only abid-
Ι ing-place. It cannot be that our life is a
bubble, cast up by the ocean of eternity,

to float another moment upon its surface‚ and
then sink into nothingness and darkness for-
ever. Else why is it that the high and glori-
ous aspiratione which leap like angels from the
temples of our hearts, are forever wandering
abroad, unsatisfied? thy is it that the rain-
bow and the cloud come over us with a beauty

that is not of earth, and then pass off and
leave us to muse on their faded loveliness?

We are born for a higher destiny than that
of earth. There is a realm where the rainbow
never fades, where the stars will be spread out
before us like the islands that slumber on the
ocean ; and where the beautiful beings that
here pass before us like visions will stay in our
presence forever! The dearest thought of
heaven is that it is home.
