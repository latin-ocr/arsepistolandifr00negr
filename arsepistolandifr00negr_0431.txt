LYMAN ABBOTT. 383

chief. ΜΓ, Abbott has written a number of books of devotion and Bibli-
cal history, a “ Life of Henry Ward Beecher‚'' and has edited Mr.
Beecher’s sermons and lectures, in addition to his many contributions to
’ periodical literature. In January, 1889, he received a call to the pastorate
of Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, where he remained ten years, and then
resigned in order to devote his time to the editorship of “ The Outlook‚''
3 periodical‚ which, under his direction, has taken high rank among

religious j ournals.

It can doubtless be claimed for Mr. Abbott that he is one of the kind

of men who make the world move, who make it go ahead.

These souls‚

superbly restless‚ are not satisfied with ancient thoughts and customs.
They respect the past, but believe one considerable part of our business

is to let go of it.

They paint an ideal future.

They are often, in fact,

generally misunderstood‚ are doubted and mistrusted, and to many

persons are enigmas.

 

LEAD THE WAY.

CANNON-BALL rolling loosely in the
cannon's mouth is simply a piece of
harmless 1113131, but with a charge of

powder behind it 1135 1113 breathless speed and
111-3515111113 power of the thunderbolt. Truth
and character are not enough 111 life; both
must have back of them the force of a con-
centrated personahty, a will on fire with zeal
and energy.

Any study of the 111311 31111 women we know
brings out not so much the differences of gifts
among them as the differences of impulse and
motivity. Some of the most richly endowed
effect little because their capital is largely
unused; some of the most ordinary in natural
ability do wonders because of the 3033311113-
tion and intensity of purpose and zeal which
dominate 1113111. Many lives are true but
hidden because their fires have never been
lighted ; others are luminous, even resplendent
because 1113 flame of purpose turns everything
into heat and light.

St. Paul was one of those torch-bearers, and
1113 light that was in him was the dawn of a
new day for half a world. Doubtless other
men of his time saw the truth clearly, and
accepted it frankly‚ but none of them put be-

hind it such a magnificent force of personality,
none of them gave it such an irresistible im-
pulse. therever he moved‚ the stagnant
air of a dying civilization was stirred by a
current that was the breath of the morning
after the close and murky night.

It was nothing to him that Asia and
Europe lay in da1·l<ness; 113 needed no light
from them on his long and painful path ; 11
was his joy to let the truth aflame 111 1115 own
50111 stream out along the coasts of the Mediter-
ranean, a solitary traveler, and yet more
powerful than emperors. Such a life reveals
the irresistible might of truth when it has set
a 50111 011 fire with purpose and enthusiasm.

The world to-day 15 full of good men and
women who are missing this sublime possibility
of giving themselves in light, heat, and force;
they have the truth, and they are anxious to
do their duty by it, but they are not luminous;
they set no new cul-rents of earnest living in
motion through the sluggish air of the world.
Instead of impr-essing themselves upon society,
they are impressed by it; instead of leading
the march, they follow in the ranks.

They need to let the truth take possession
of them, to lose themselves and all conscious-
