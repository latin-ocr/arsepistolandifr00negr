HORATIUS.

FROM “HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.''

LONE stood brave Horatius,
But constant still in mind ;

Thrice thirty thousand foes before,
And the broad flood behind.

With parted lips and straining eyes,
Stood gazing where he sank:
And when above the surges
They saw his erest appear,
All Rome sent forth a rapturous cry,
And even the ranks of Tuscany
could scarce forbear to cheer.

But fiercely ran the current,
Swollen high by months of rain;
