100 JoHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER.

Ho l—strike away the bars and blocks, Where’er‚ in mah-t or on the main,
And set the good ship free! With peaceful flag unfurled, ἶ
Why linger on these dusty rocks She helps to wind the silken chain 2
The young bride of the sea? Of commerce round the world! ᾗ
Look Ξ how she moves adown the grooveS,
1„ graceful beauty now! Be hers the prairie’s golden grain,
How lowly on the breast she loves The desert’s gOIdeD Sflssd»
Sinks down her virgin prow! The clustered fruits of sunny Spain,
The spice of morning-land!
God bless her! wheresoe’er the breeze Her pathway on the open main
Her snowy wings shall fan, May blessings follow free,
Aside the frozen Hebrides, And glad hearts welcome back again
Or sultry Hindostan Ξ Her white sails from the sea!
THE WELL OF LOGH MAREE.
ALM on the breast of Loch Maree O! restless heart and fevered brain,
A little isle reposes; Unquiet and unstable,
A shadow woven of the oak That holy well of Loch Maree
And willow o’er it closeS. Is more than idle fable!
within, a Druid's mound is seen, Life’s changes veX, its discords stun, ’
Set round with stony warders3 Its glaring sunshine blindeth, .
A fountain, gushing through the turs, And blest is he who on his way ,
Flows o'er its grassy box-ders. That fount of healing findeth!
And whoso bathes therein his brow, The shadows of a humbled will .
With care or madness burning, And contrite beart are o'er it:
Feels once again his healthfnl thought Go read its legend—“ TRUST ΙΝ Gon ”-·
And sense of peace returning. On Faith’s white stones before it. Ξ
THE: BAREFoo‘r BoY. ξ
LESSINGS on thee, little man, Outward sunshine, inward joy, ,.”
Barefoot boy, with cheek of tan ἲ, Blessings on the barefoot boy.
With thy turned up pantaloons‚
And thy merry whistled tnnes; 0! for boyhood’s painless play,
With thy red lip, redder still Sleep that wakes in langhing day,
Kissed by strawberries on the hill ; Health that mocks the doctor’s rules,
With the sunshine on thy face, Knowledge never learned of schools:
Through thy torn brim's jaunty grace! Of the wild bee's morning chase,
From my heart I give thee joy ; Of the wild flower’s time and place,
I was once a bai-efoot boy. Flight of fowl, and habitude
Prince thou art—the grown-up man, Of the tenants of the wood ;
Only is republican. How the tortoise bears his shell,
Let the inillion-dollared ride! How the woodchnck digs his cell,
Barcfoot, trudging at his side, And the ground-mole sinks his well;
Thou hast more than he can buy, How the robin feeds her young,

In the reach of ear and eye: How the oriole's nest is hung;
