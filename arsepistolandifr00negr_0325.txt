and seeming fondly to cling around it, are
not means of annoyance to you, but your
country’s own means of distinction and de-
fence. All is peace3 and God has granted
you this sight of your country’s happiness, ere
you slumber in the grave. He has allowed
you to behold and to partake the reward of
your patriotic toils; and he has allowed us,
your sons and countrymen, to meet you here,
and in the name of the present generation, in
the name of your country, in the name of
liberty to thank you l

fathers, and live only to your country in her
grateful remembrance and your own bright
example. But let us not too much grieve
that you have met the common fate of men.
You lived at least long enough to know that
your work had been nobly and successfully
accomplished. You lived to see your coun-
try's independence established, and to sheathe
your swords from war. On the light of Lib-
erty you saw arise the light of Peace, like

LIBERTY AND UNION.

The most remarkable debate in the history of the United States was that which took
place between Webster and Hayne of South Carolina. The closing part of Mr. Webster’s
speech is here inserted. No other American orator ever rose to the height of majestic elo·
quence exhibited on this occasion by the imperial defender of the Union.

PROFESS, sir, in my career hitherto, to
have kept steadily in view the prosperity
and honor of the whole country, and the
preservation of our F ederal Union. It is to
that Union we owe our safety at home, and
our consideration and dignity abroad. It is
to that Union we are chiefly indebted for what-
ever makes ns most proud of our country.
That Union we reached only by the discipline
of our virtues, in the severe school of adver-
sity. It had its origin in the necessities of
disordered finance, prostrate commerce, and
ruined credit.

Under its benign influence's, these great
interests immediately awoke, as from the dead,
and sprang forth with newness of life. Every
year of its duration has teemed with fresh
proofs of its utility and its blessings; and
although our territory has stretched out wider
and wider, and our population spread further
and further, they have not outrun its protec-
tion, or its benefits. It has been to us all a
copious fountain of national, social, personal
lmppinezs

Ι have not allowed myself, sir, to look

 

beyond the Union to see what might lie hidden
in the dark recess behind. Ι have not coolly
weighed the chances of preserving liberty,
when the bonds that unite us together shall
be broken asunder. I have not accustomed
myself to hang over the precipice of disunion
to see whether, with my short sight, Ι can
fathom the depth of the abyss below; nor
could I regard him as a safe counsellor in the
affairs of this goverment whose thoughts
should be mainly bent on cousidering, not
how the Union should be best preserved, but
how tolerable might be the condition of the
people when it shall be broken up and des-
troyed.

While the Union lasts, we have high, excit-
ing, gratifying prospects spread out before us
and our children. Beyond that Ι seek not to
penetrate the veil. God grant that, in my
day, at least, that curtain may not risel God
grant that on my vision never may be opened
what lies behind! then my eyes shall be
turned to behold, for the last time, the Snn in
Heaven, may Ι not sce him shining On the

broken and dishonored fragments of a once
