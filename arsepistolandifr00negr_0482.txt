HOW OYRUS LAID THE OABLE.

Cyrus W. Field organized the ί(1111311110 Telegraph C‹›1npany'’ in 1856 for the purpose

of connecting

Europe and America by a sub-marine cable. After two failures in 1857 and

1858, the project was successfully aecoxnplished in August, 1866. T his-was due 1-0 Mr. Field’s
masterly business ability and unsaltering perseverence. He was born in Stockbrldge‚ Massa-

chusetts, 111 1819, and died ,July 26, 1892.

OME, listen to my song, it is nosilly fabio,
'Tis all about the mighty cord they 01111
1116 Atlantia Cable.

Bold Cyrus Field‚ said he, “I have a pretty

notion
That I could run a telegraph across the At-
lantic Oceanf’

And all the people laughed 31111 said they’d
like to sce him do it;

He might got “half seas over,'’ but never
would go through it.

To carry out 1113 foolish plan he never would
be able;

He might as well go hang himself with his
Atlantia Cable.

But Cyrus was a valiant man, a fellow os

decision,
And heeded not their careless 1101113, 111611·
laughter and 1161131011.

Twiee did his bravest effort fail, yet his mind
was stable ;

He wasn't the man to break his heart because
he broke his cable.

 

 

“ Once more, my gallant boyS‚’' said 116 : “ffiree
times‚'’—you know the fable.

¹ “ ΓΠ make it thirty,’' muttered 116, “but what

I’ll lay my cable.'’

Hurrah 1 hurrah! again hurrah! what means
this great commotion ἶ)

Hnrrah! huri-ah 1 The cable's laid across the
Atlantia Ocean.

Loud ring the bells‚ for flashing through ten
thousand leagues of water,

Old Mother England's benison salutes her
eldest daughter.

O'er all the land the tidings spread, and soon
in every nation,

They'll hear about the cable with profoundest
admiration.

Long live the gallant souls who helped our
noble Cyrus ;

And may their courage, saith, and zeal, with
emulation fire us.

And may we honor, evermore, the manly,
bold and stable,

And tell our sons, to make thern brave, how
Cyrus laid the Cable.

Α LIFE on the ocean wave,

A home on the rolling deep;
there the scattered waters rave,
And the winds their revels keep 1

Died December

Like an angel eaged I pine

On this dull⁷ unohanging shore:
O, give me the flashing brine,

The spray and the tempest's roarl
