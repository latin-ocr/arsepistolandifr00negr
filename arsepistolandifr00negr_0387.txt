LYDIA MARIA CHILD.

sing like a bird, in keeping with the street
organ. Two other young girls came and
leaned on her shoulder; and still she sang on.
Blessings on her gentle heart! It was evi-
dently the spontaneous gush of human love
and sympathy. The beauty of the incident
attracted attention. A group of gentlemen
gradually collected round the organist; and
ever as the tune ended, they bowed respect-
fully toward the window, waved their hats,
and called out, “ More, if you please? '' One,
whom I knew well for the kindest and truest
soni, passed round his hat; hearts were kin dled,
and the silver fell in freely. In a minute,
four or five dollars were collected for the poor
woman. She spoke no word of gratstude, but
she gave such, a look!

“ Will you go to the next street, and play
to a friend of mine?” said my kind—hearted
friend. She answered, in tones expressing the
deepest emotion. “ No, sir, God bless you all

—God bless you all,'’ ζ making a courtesy to
the young lady, who had stepped back, and
stood sheltered by the curtain of the window,)
“ Ι will play no more to-day ; I will go home,

now.’'
The tears trickled down her cheeks, and as

she walked away, she had ever and anon
wiped her eyes with the corner of her shawl.
The group of gentlemen lingered a moment
to look after her, then turning toward the now
closed-window, they gave three enthusiastic
cheers‚ and departed, better than they came.
The pavement on which they stood had been
a church to them 3 and for the next hour, at
least, their hearts were more than usually
prepared for deeds of gentleness and mercy.
Why are such scenes so uncommon? Why
do we thus repress our sympathies, and chill
the genial current of nature, by formal ob-
servances and restraints?

THE BEAUTY AND USES OF FLOWERS.

OW the universal heart of man blesses
flowersl They are wreathed round
the cradle, the marriage—altar, and the

tomb. The Persian in the far East delights
in their persume, and writes his love in nose-
gays; while the Indian child of the far West
clasps his hands with glee‚ as he gathers the
abundant blossoms—the illuminated scripture
of the prairies. The Cupid of the ancient
Hindoos tipped his arrows with fiowers ς and
orange-buds are the bridal crown with us, a
nation of yesterday. Flowers garlanded the

Grecian altar, and they hang in votive
wreaths before the Christian shrine.

All these are appropriate uses. Flowers
should deck the brow of the youthful bride3
for they are in themselves a lovely type of
marriage. They should twine round the
tomb; for their perpet-ually renewed beauty
is a symbol of the resurrection. They should
festoon the altar; for their fragrance and

their beauty ascend in perpetual worship
before the Most High.

“ Brignal banks are fresh and fair,

Every thing seemed happy, and laying her hand on her brother’s
