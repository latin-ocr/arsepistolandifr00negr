Journalist‚ Novelist and Poet.

   

ἣ R. J. G. HOLLAND was born at Belchertown, Mass, July 24,
’ ’ ’ 1819. ἍῘ11611 he had partly completed his studies, preparatory
,j to entering college, his health became enfeebled by too severe
application, and he concluded, after a period of relaxation, to
study medicine, which he did, in the meantime teaching as a
means of support. In 1845, he took his degree of M. D, at
the Berkshire Medical College, Pittsfield, Mass, and practiced about two
years at Springfield, where he married Elizabeth L. Chapin.

He afterwards became teacher 01 a private school at Richmond‚ Va.,
101 three months, and then accepted the appointment of Superintendent
of Public Schools in Vicksburg, Miss. While there, he wrote frequently
for the press: but, after discharging the duties of his office with great
satisfaction for a year and a half, he accepted an offer as editor of the
“ Springfield Republican‚'’ and removed back to Massachusetts. He
discharged his editorial duties with such tact and ability, that that paper
became one of the most successful and widely known and quoted J ournals
in the country.

In 1855, Dr. Holland published the “ History of VVestern Massa-
chusetts,'' of four counties, in 2 vols, 12mo.‚ which he had written the
previous year. In 1857, appeared the ‘⁸' Bay Path,’' a novel founded on
some of the colonial incidents of his history3 which did not meet with
much success, nor at a later period when it was reissued.

In 1858, 116 reprinted from the “ Republican,'' ‘⁴ Timothy T 1160111ὺέ-
Letters to Young People,” that had an immediate and great succeSS, and
which very deservedly still continues. Eminently successful in their

Ι manner and adaptation to the wants of the country, they attracted

attention for their beauty of style, purity of English, and sound common
sense. The advice contained in them is excellent, entirely practical,
