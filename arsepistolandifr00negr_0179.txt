NATHANIEL PARKER WILLIS. 137

In my own land of Egypt, the far Nile, How can Ι leave my boy, so pillowed there
How prayed Ι that my father's land might be Upon his clustering hair 1 '⁷
An heritage for thee!

She stood beside the well her God had

“ And now the grave for its cold breast hath given
won thee, To gush iu that deep wilderness, and bathed
And thy white delicate limbs the earth will The forehead of her child until hc laughed
press; In his reviving happiness, and lisped

And, O! my last caress His infant thought of gladness at the sight
Must feel thee cold, for a chill hand is on thee. Of the 6001 plashing of his mother's hand.

 

TWO WOMEN.

HE shadows lay along Broadway, And the rich came not to woo,-——
Τ ’Τ was near the twilight-tide, But honored well are charms to 5611
And slowly there a lady fair If priests the selling do.
lVas walking in her pride.
Alone walked she 3 but viewlessly‚
Wnlked spirits at 1161· side.

Now walking there was 0116 111016 fain-—
A slight girl, lily pale ;
And she had unseen company

Peace charmed the street beneath her feet, To make the spirit quail,-—-
And honor charmed the air 'Twixt want and 560111 5116 walked forlorn
And all astir looked kind on her, And nothing could avail.

And called her good as fair,—
For all God ever gave to her
She kept with chary care.

No mercy now can clear her brow
For this world’s peace to pray;
For, as love’s wild prayer dissolved in air,

She kept with care her beauties rare Her woman's heart gave way!
From lovers warm and true, But the sin forgiven hy Christ 111 heaven
For her heart was cold to all but gold By man is eursed alway 1

 

SATURDAY AFTERNOON.

LOVE to look on a 566116 like this, Play on 1 play on! Ι am with you there,
Of wild and careless play, In the midst of your merry ring;
And persuade myself that Ι am not old, Ι can feel the thrill of the daring jump,
And my locks are not yet gray ; And the rush of the breathless swing.
For it stirs the blood in an old mau’s heart, Ι hide with you in the fragrant hay,
And makes his pulses fly, And Ι whoop the smothered call,
To catch the thrill of a happy voice, f And my feet slip up 011 the seedy floor,
And the light of a pleasant eye. And Ι care not for the fall.
Ι have walked the world for fourscorc years, Ι am willing to die when my time shall come,
And they say that I am old— And Ι shall he glad to go—
That my heart is ripe for the reaper Death, For the world, at best, is a weary place,
And my years are well-nigh told. And my pulse is getting low;
It is very true—it is very true— - But the grave 15 dark, and the heart will fail
· I am old, and Ι “ bide my time ;'' In treading its gloomy way ;
But my heart will leap at a 566116 like this, And it wiles my heart from its dreariness

And Ι half renew my prime. To see the young 50 gay.
