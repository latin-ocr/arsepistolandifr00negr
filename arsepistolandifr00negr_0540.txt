492 ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.

And God knows, who sees us twain‚
Child at ehildish leisure,
Ι um all as tired of pain
As you are of pleasure.
Very soon, too, by His grace,
Geutly wrapt around me,
Ι shall show as calm a fuce,
Ι >shall sleep as soun‹lly--
Difl'ering in this, that you
Clusp your pluythings sleeping‚
thile my hand must drop the few
Given to my keeping—

Differing in this, that I,
Sleeping‚ must be eolder,
And, in waking presently,
Brighter to beholder—
Differing in this beside
(Sleeper, have you heard me?
Do you move, and open wide
Your great eyes toward me 1)
That while Ι you draw withal
From this slumber solely,
Me, from mine, an angel shall,
Trumpet-tongued and holyl

MY HEART AND I.

N OUGH 1 we’re tired, my heart and Ι :

We sit, beside the headstone thus,

l “ Dear Love, you're looking tired,'' he said ;

I, smiling at him, shook my head ;

And wish the name were earved for us; 'Tjs now We’re til-ed, my beart and 1·

The moes repriuts more tenderly
The hard types: of the mason’s knife,

As Heaven's sweet life renews earth’s life,

With which we‘re tired, my heart and I.

You see we're tired, my heart and Ι ;
We dealt with books, we trusted men,
And in our own blood drenehed the pen,
As if such colors eould not fly.

We walked too straight for fortune's end,

We loved too true to keep a friend;
At last we’re tired, my heart and Ι.

How tired we feel, my heart and I ;

We seem of no use in the world3

Our fancies hang gray and uueurled
About men's eyes indifferently ;

Our voice, which thrilled you so, will let

You sleep ; our tears are only wet ;
What (lo we here, my heart and I?

So tired, so tired, my heurt and I ;

It was not thus in that old time

XVheu Ralph sat with me ’neath the lime
To watch the sun set from the sky :

So tired, so tired, my heart and I!
Though now none takes me on his arm
To fold me close and kiss me warm,

Till each quiok breath ends in a sigh
Of happy languor. Now, alone
We lean upon his graveyard stone,

Uneheered‚ unkissed, my heart and I.

Tired out we are, my heart and I.
Suppose the world brought diadems
To tempt us, erusted with loose gems

Of powers and pleasures? Let it try.
We scarcely care to look at even
A pretty child, or God's blue heaven,

We feel so tired, my heart and Ι.

Yet, who complains? My heart and I?
In this abundant earth no doubt
Is little room for things worn out;
Disdain them, break them, throw them by ;
And if before the days grew rough,
W'e once were loved, then—well enough
Ι think we've sared, my heart and I.
