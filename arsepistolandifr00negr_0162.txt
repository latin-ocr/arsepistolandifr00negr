124 JAMES RUSSELL LowELL.

’T was kin’ o' kingdom-come to look
On sech a blessed cretur,

A dogrose blushin’ 1ο a brook
Ain’t modester nor sweeter.

He was six foot 0’ man, A 1,
Clean grit an’ human natur’;
None couldn’t quicker piteh a ton
Nor dror a furrer straighter.

He’d sparked it with full twenty gals, ⁷.-
Hed squired 'em‚ danced ’em, druv 'em,
Fust this 0116, 1111’ then thet, by 5116115-

All 15, 116 couldn't love ’em.

But long o' her his veins ’ould run
All criukly like curled maple,

The side 5116 breshed felt full o’ sun
Ez a south slope in Ap’il.

She thought no v’ice hed sech a swing
Ez hisn 111 1116 011011;

My! when 116 made Ole Hundred ring,
She knowed the Lord was nigher.

An' she'd blush searlit‚ right in prayer,
When her new meetin'-l)unnet

Felt somehow thru’ its erown a pair
O' blue eyes sot upon it.

Thet night, Ι tell ye, she looked some ,Ι
8116 seemed to 've gut a new soul,

For 5116 felt sartin-sure he'd come,
Down to her very shoe-sole.

She heered a foot, an' knowed it tu,
A-raspin' 011 1116 seraper,—

All ways to once her feelin's ssew
Like sparks in burnt-up paper.

He kin’ o’ l’itered on the mat,
Some doubtfie 0’ the sekle,
His heart kep' goin’ pity-pat,
’ But hern went pity Zekle.

An' yit she gin her 011661 a jerk

Ez though she wished him furder,

An' ou her apples kep' to work,

Parin' away like murder.

‘⁴ You want to see my Pa, I s’pose?”
“Wal . . . no . . . I come dasignin' '’—

“ To see my Ma? She's sprinklin' clo’es
Agin to-morrer’s i'nin’.”

To say why gals acts so or 50, l
Or don't, ’ould be presumin’; ἑ
Mebby to mean yes an’ say ηο ξ,
Comes nateral to women. [ξ’

He stood a spell on one foot fust,
Then stood a spell on t'other,
An' on which one he felt the wust

He couldn’t ha' told ye nuther.

Saye he, “ I'd better call agin ”3
Says she, “ Think likely, Mister'';
Thet last word pricked him like a pin,
An' . . . Wal‚ he up an’ kist her.

When Ma bimeby upon 'em elipe,
Huldy sot pale ez ashes,

All kin’ o’ smily roun’ the lips
An’ teary roun' the lashes.

For she was jes' the quiet kind
those naturs never vary,

Like streams that keep a summer mind
Snowhid in Jenooary.

The blood 01051 101111’ 1161 heart felt glued
Too tight for all expressin’,

Tell mother see how metters stood,
And gin ’em both her blessin'.

Then her red come back like the tide
Down to the Bay o’ Fundy,

An' all I know 15 they was cried
In meetin’ come nex' Sunday.
