⁴ Sir, if it be his object to thrust me between
the gentleman from Missouri and himself, in
order to rescue the East from the contest it
has provoked with the VVest, he shall not be
gratified. Ι will not be dragged into the de-
fence of my friend from Missouri. The South
shall not be forced into a conflict not its own.

The gentleman from Missouri is able to fight
his own battles. The gallant VVest needs no
aid from the south to repel any attack which
may be made on them from any quarter.
Let the gentleman from Massachusetts con-
trovert the facts and arguments of the gentle-
man from Missouri, if h'e can; and, if he win
the victory, let him wear the honors. Ι shall
not deprive him of his laurels, or disparari-21
his achievements.

 

SOUTH OAROLINA IN THE REVOLUTION.

F there be one state in the Union, Mr.
President (and Ι say it not in a boastful
spirit), that may challeuge comparison

with any other, for an unform, zealous,
ardent, and uncalculating devotion to the
Union, that State is South Carolina. Sir,
from the very commencement of the Revolu-
tion, up to this hour, there is no sacrifice,
however great, she has not cheerfully made—
no service she has ever hesit-ated to perform.
She has adhered to you in your prosperity3
but in your adversity she has clung to you
with more than filial affection.

No matter what was the condition of her
domestic affairs—though deprived of her re-
sources, divided by parties, or surrounded
with difficulties—the call of the country has
been to her as the voice of God. Domestic
discord ceased at the sound; every man be-
came at once reconciled to his brethren‚ and
the sons of Carolina were all scen crowding
together to the temple, bringing their gifts to
the altar of their common country.

What, sir, was the conduct of the south
during the Revolution‘? Sir, Ι honor New
England for her conduct in that glorious
struggle. But, great as is the praise which
belongs to her, Ι think at least equal honor is
due to the South. They espoused the quarrel
of their brethren with a generous zeal, which
:did not suffer them to stop to calculate their

interest in the dispute. Favorites of tha
mother country, possessed of neither shipz-v
nor seamen to create a commercial rivalship
they might have found in their situation ει
guarantee that their trade would be for ever
fostered and protected by Great Britain.

But, trampling on all considerations either
of interest or safety, they rushed into the
conflict, and, fighting for principle, perilled
all, in the sacred cause of freedom. Nevcr
was there exhibited, in the history of the
world, higher examples of noble daring, dread-
ful suffering, and heroic endurance, than by
the Whigs of Carolina during the Revolution.
The whole state, from the mountains to the
sea, was overrun by an overwhelming force of
the enemy. The fruits of industry perished
on the spot where they were produced, or were
consumed by the foe.

The “plains of Carolina'' drank up the
most precious blood of her citizens. Black
and smoking ruins marked the places which
had been the habitations of her children!
Driven from their homes into the gloomy and
almost impenetrable swamps, even there the
spirit of liberty survived; and South Caro-
lina, sustained by the example of her Sumters
and her Marions, proved, by her conduct, that
though her soil might be overrun, the spirit of
her people was invincible.
