me HUNTLEY SIGOURNEY.

“ The American Heman5.''

 

RS. SIGOURNEY'S graceful poems appeared at a time when
¹ γ ² our country could boast of no poetess of first rank. Mrs. ·
Hemaus, born in England three years later than MrS. Sigour-
l* ney’s birth in Norwich‚ Conn., which occurred in 1791, was
becoming celebrated by those exquisite productioris which
have long been favorites with the lovers of verse. By common
consent the two names were associated and Mrs. Sigourney was denomi-
nated “The American Henians.‘' She was, however, a much more volu-
minous author in prose than her famous contemporary in England.

At the time she wrote and published her poems there were no authors
to rival her claims to high distinction. Female writers had not appeared
in American literature, and she has the prestige of being a pioneer. That
she had remarkable gifts may be conceded without dispute. That the
moral, elevatiug, healthful tone of her writings was always apparent, is
equally beyond question. She appealed to th'e thoughtful, cultivated
intelligence of her readerS, who always found in her productions a stimu-
lus toward right living and doing.

Beloved and honored by a wide circle of friends and admirers, per-

 

haps it is not too much to say that Mrs. Sigourney was an ideal woman -

of culture, of genius, industry and elevated aims. Her long and suc-

cessful career is a matter of historic record. That one who wrote so con· ·

stantly should have invariably written so well, evinces gifts of no ordinary
character. Δ,

After finishing her education, she taught for five years a select class ’
of young ladies at Hartford. In 1819 she was married to Charles Sigour- Ι
ney, a Hartford merchant of literary and artistic tastes. She thenceforth ᾗ
devoted her leisure hours to literature, at first to gratify her aown inclina-

tion, and subsequently, after her husband had lost the greater part of his .

fortune, to add to her income.
From her early contributions to periodicals her first volume, ‘⁴ Moral ν

 

Pieces of Prose and Verse.'‘ was issued in 1815. More ambitious were .
