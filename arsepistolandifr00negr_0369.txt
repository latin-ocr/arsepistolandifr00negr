FlsHER AMES.
Orator of the First Federal Congress

, ‚YQV

)ἾΙΞΗΕΚ AMES was regarded by many of his contemporaries as
ff& one 01 1116 greatest men who had 111611 in this country. He
&w was the leader of the Federal party in the House 01 Represen-

tatives during 1116 3(11111111511311011 01 Washington‚ and was

  

  
   

applauded for his eloquence and learning, the solidity 01 1115
judgment, and the unsullied purity 01 1115 public and private
conduct. As an orator 116 was without a rival.

He was born in Dedham‚ Massachusetts‚ on the ninth of April, 17 583
entered Harvard College when twelve years of age3 took his degree at
sixteen; and in 1781 commenced the practice of law. The ability he had
manifested in occasional public speeches, and in various political contri-
butions to the gazettes‚ in 1788 procured him an election to the Massa-
chusetts convention for ratifying the Federal Constitution3 he was soon
after made a member 01 1116 State Legislature; and the people of Boston
chose him to be their first representative in the Congress of the United
States.

His most celebrated speech in this body was delivered on the twenty-
ninth day 01 April, 1796, in support 01 1116 Treaty with Great Britain,
which a considerable party was anxious to repudiate, although it had
been approved by the Executive. He was so feeble, from a severe and
protracted 11111655, when he arose, that it seemed doubtful whether he
would be able to do more than enter a protest against the proposed viola-
tion 01 public faith3 but as he proceeded he acquired a factitious strength
from his enthusiasm‚ and when he sat down, with an allusion to his
“ slender and almost broken hold upon life‚’' the effect which had been
produced was so great that a postponement 01 1116 consideration of the
subject was moved on the part of the opposition, lest the House should
act under the influence of feelings which would be condemned by their
judgment This and his speech on Mr. Madison's resolutionS‚ are the
only ones 01 which we have reports‚ though he was not an unfrequent

debater
