we live 111 011 age of shams, Miss Dodge cannot be held responsible for
any of them, for there never was a person who believed less 111 humbug

and hypocrisy and more 111 solid substantia] principles and virtue.

She

has given works to our literature that will long survive her.

A DAY’S SPORT.
FRoM “GALA DAYs.”

SOME people have conscientious scruples search of “fun ; ’' practice irregular and in-

about fishing. Ι respect them. I had

‹lescribable gymnastics with variable success

them myself· xVfflltffllly ¹30 (ῙΘΒῈΥΟΥ, f01' for half an 110111 or so. 8110111 from the bridge,

mere sport, the innocent life 111 lake 01· river,
seemed to me a cruelty and a shame. But
people must fish. Now, 111011, how shall your
theory and practice be harmonized? Practice
can't yield. Plainly, theory must. A year
ago Ι went out on a rock in the Atlantic
. Ocean, held a line—just to see how it seemed
—and caught eight fishes; and every time a
fish came up a scruple went down. Which
facts will partially account for the eagerness
with whi ch I, one morning, seconded a proposal
to go a-fishing in a river about foui-teen miles
away.

They go to the woods, Ι hang my prospective
trout on my retrospective rod and march river-
wards. Halicarnassus, according to the old
saw, “leaves this world and climbs a tree‚'’
and, with jackknife‚ cord and perseverance,
manufactures a fishing-rod, which 110 courte-
ously offers to me, which Ι succinctly decline,
informing him in no ambiguous phrase that Ι
consider nothing beneath the best as good
enough for me. Halicarnassus is convinced
by my logic, overpowered by my rhetoric,
and meekly yields up the best rod, though the
natural man rebels, The bank of the river is
rocky, steep, shrubby, and difficult of ascent
or descent. Halicarnassus bids me tarry 011
the bridge, while he descends to reconnoitre.
I am acquiescent, and lean over the railing
awaiting the result of investigation. Hali·
carnassus picks his way over rocks, sideways
and zigzaggy along the bank, and down the
river in search of fish. I grow tired of play-
ing Cassabianca and steal behind the bridge,
and pick my way over the rocks sidewise and
zigzaggy along the bank and up the river, in

Ι look up. Το0 far off to hear the words, but
see Halicarnassus gesticulating furiously, and
evidently laboring under great excitement.
Retrograde as rapidly as circumstances will
permit. Halicarnassus makes a speaking
trumpet of his hands and roars, “ I’ve found—
a 113111 Left—him for—you—to catch! come

quick1'' and plunging headlong down the
bank ‹lisappears. Ι 0111 touched 10 1110 heart
by this sublime instance of sels-denial and
devotion, and scramble up to the bridge, and
plunge down after him. Heel of boot gets
tangled iu. hem of dress every third step—
fishing-line in tree-top every second; progress
therefore not so rapid as could be desired.
Reach the water at last. Step cautiously from
rock to rock to the middle of the stream—-
balance on a pebble just large enough to plant
both feet 011, and just firm enough 10 make it
worth while 10 11111 1110 risk—drop my line
into the spot ‹lesiguated—a quiet, black little
pool in the rushing river—see no fish, but
have faith in Halicarnassus.

“ Bite? '' asks Halicarnassus, eagerly.

“Not yet‚'’ Ι answered, sweetly. Breath-
less expectation. Lips compressed. Eyes
fixed. Five minutes gone.

“ Bite ? '' calls Halicarnassus from down the
river.

“ Not yet,'' hopefully.

“Lower your line a little. I'll come in a
minute.'’ Line is lowered. Arms begin to
ache. Rod suddenly bobs down. Snatch it
up. Only 011 old stick. Splash it off con-
temptuously.

“ Bite?’' calls Halicarnassus from afar.
