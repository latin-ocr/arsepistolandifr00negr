ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 183

whole country and brought out brilliantly Mr. Lincoln's great power in
debate, his ready eloquence, his practical common sense, his fund of
humor, and placed him among the foremost men of the country, preparing
the way for his 616611611 16 1116 Presidency in 1860.

He did all that lay in his power to avert the Civil War, but plainly
avowed his intention to uphold‚ according to his oath, the Constitution
and administration of the laws of the country. How ably, how wisely,
how fearlessly, and with what fidelity to his country’s cause he did this,
with what charity toward 1115 6116111165 116 carried himself, with what far-
sighted wisdom his public measures were promulgated‚ and how he stood
like a massive, unmovable tower of strength through the great conflict
. 11131 rocked our nation, 15 now a matter of well-known history.

The Federal arms having been victorious after many defeats, and
Mr. Lincoln having proved himself to be master of the situation, he was
re-elected by a large popular majority in 1864. 111 his second inaugural
address in March, 1865, he rose above the ordinary range of such occa-
sions, and like an inspired prophet set forth the profound moral signifi—
cance of the war he saw drawing to a close. A month later he entered
Richmond, from which Grant had driven Davis and Lee.

On the 14th of April, 1865, 116 was assassinated by J. Wilkes Booth,
an actor, and died the next morning. The national rejoicing over the
return of peace was turned into grief for the martyred President. The
whole civilized world joined in expressions of sorrow for his fate.

Mr. Lincoln’s state papers and speeches are models of plain English,
good sense and lofty thought. He wrote and said things that are a
permanent part of American literature, although not an author in the
strict meaning of the term.

ADDRESS AT THE DEDIGATION OF GETTYSBURG OEMETERY.

No utterance of any public man has been more admired for its eloquence and appropri-
1111136Ξίεὲ <1381116 occasion than Mr. Lincoln’s address at Gettysburg. It will live as long as his

battle-field of that war. We are met to dedi-
cate 3 portion of it as the final resting-place
of those who here gave their lives that that
nation might live.

It is altogether fitting and proper that we
should do this. But in a larger sense we
cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we
cannot hallow this ground. The brave men,

OURSCORE and seven years ago our
fathers brought forth upon this conti-
nent a new natiwn, conceived 111 liberty,

and dedicated to the proposition that all men
are created equal, Now we are engaged in 3
great civil war, testing whether that nation,
or any nation so conceived and so dedicated,
,6311 10118 endure. We are met on a great
