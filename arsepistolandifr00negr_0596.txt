548 THOMAS HOOD.

I rememher‚ Ι remember,
WVhere I was used to swing,

And thought the air must rusb as fresh

To swallows on the wing ;
My spirit fiew in feathers then,

That is so heavy now,
And summer pools could hardly cool

The sever on my brow!

 

AUTUMN.
HE autumn is old; The year’s in the wane ;
The sear leaves are flying; There is nothing adorning;
He hath gathered up gold, The night has no eve,
And now he is dying: And the day has no morning;
Old age, begin sighing! Cold winter gives warning.
The vintage is ripe; The rivers run chill;
The harvest is heaping ; The red sun is sinking;
But some that have sowed And I am grown old,
Have 110 ri‹·.hes for reaping— And life is fast shrinking ;
Poor wretch, sall a-weeping! Here’s enow for sad thinking!
’ ΝΟ 1-

Ο sun—no moon!
No morn—no noon—

No dawn-no dust-——no proper time of

No sky—no earthly view—

No distance looking blue— [way ”—
No road——no street—no “ t’other side the No park—-no ring-—no asternoon gentility—

No end to any row-

No indications where the crescents go— No warmth, no cheerfulness, no healthful ease,

No top to any steeple—

No recognitions of familiar people—
No com-tesies for showing 'eni-—
No kuowing ’enil

 

FAITHLESS NELLY GRAY.

EN BATTLE was a soldier bold,
And used to war's alarms;
But a cannon-hall took off his legs,
So he laid down his arms!

Now as they bore him off the field,
Said he, “ Let others shoot,

For here I leave my second leg,
And the Forty-second Foot ! ''

No traveling at all—no locomotion‚
[day— No inkling of the way—no notion—

Ι remember, I remember,
The fir-trees dark and high ;

Ι used to think their slender tops
WVere close against the sky ε

It was a ehildish ignorance,
But now ’tis little joy

To know I’m further off from heaven
Than when I was a boy.

“ No go ''—by land or ocean—
No mail—no post—
No news from any foreign coast—-

 

No company—no nobility—

No comfortable feel in any member-
No shade, no shine‚ no butterfiies‚ no bees,
No fruits, no fiowers, no leaves, no birds.
November !

The army-surgeons made him limbs:
Said he-—“ They're only pegs;

But there's as wooden members quite
As represent my legs! '²

Now Ben he loved a pretty maid,
Her name was Nelly Gray !

So he went to pay her his devours
When he’d devoured his pay.
