JOHN GREENLEAF WHrrTmR. 97

And ask a draught from the spring that flowed “ But low of cattle, and song of birds‚

Through the meadow across the residu!

And health, and quiet, and loving words.’'

She stooped where the 0001 spring bubbled up, But he thought of his sisters, proud and cold,

And filled for him her small tin-cup,

And blushed as she gave it, looking down
On her feet so bare and her tattered gown.

“Thanks! ’' said the J udge, “ a sweeter draught
From a fairer hand was never quaffed.”

He spoke of the grass and flowers and trees,
Of the singing birds and the humming bees;

Then talked of the haying and wondered
whether
The cloud in the west would bring foul weather.

And Maud forgot her briar·torn gown,
And her graceful ankles bare and brown ;

And listened, while a pleased surprise
Looked from her long-lashed hazel eyes.

At last, like one who for delay
’ 866118 3 vain excuse, he rode away.

Maud Muller looked and sighed : “ Ah, me!
That Ι the Judge’s bride might be 1 s

“He would dress me up in silks so fine,
And praise and toast me at his wine.

“ My father should wear a broadcloth coat ;
My brother should sail a painted boat.

“I'd dress my mother so grand and gay,
And the baby should have a new toy each day.

‘⁴ And I’d seed the hungry and elothe the poor,
And all should bless me who left our door.’'

The J udge looked back as he climbed the hill,
And saw Maud Muller standing still.

‘⁴ A form more fair, a face more sweet‚
Ne'er hath it been my lot to meet.

“ And her modest answer and graceful air
Show her wise and good as she is fair.

“Would she were mine, and I to·day,
Like her, a harvester of hay:

‘⁴ No doubtful balance of rights and wrongs,
Nor weary lawyers with endless tongues,
7

And his mother, vain of her rank and gold.

So, closing his heart, the Judge rode on,
And Maud was left in the field 310116.

But the lawyers smiled that afternoon,
then he hummed in court 311 old love-tune;

And the young girl mused beside the well,
Till the rain on the unraked clover fell.

He wedded a wife of richest dower,
tho lived for fashion, as he for power.

Yet oft, 111 1118 marble hearth's bright glow,
He watched a picture come and go :

And sweet Maud Muller's hazel eyes
Looked out in their innocent surprise.

Oft when the wine in his glass was red,
He longed for the wayside well instead :

And closed his eyes 011 1118 garnished rooms, .
To dream of meadows and clover-blooms. ,

And the proud man sighed, witha secret pain²
“ Ah, that Ι were free again! s

“ Free as when I rode that day, ·
Where the barefoot maiden raked her hay·’.⁷

She wedded a man unlearned and poorf
And many children played round her door. ,

But care and sorrow, and child-birth pain,
Left their traces on heart and brain.

And oft, when the summer sun 8110116 hot -
On the new-mown hay 111 the meadow lot,

And she heard the little spring brook falls
Over the roadside, through the wall,

In the shade of the apple-tree again
She saw a rider draw his rein,

And, gazing down with timid grace,
She felt his pleased eyes read her face.

Sometimes her narrow kitchen walls
Stretched away into stately halls;
