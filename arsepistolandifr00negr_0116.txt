door. I ran up the steps with the children at
my heels, and at the top met a blaze of light
coming from the open door, that dazzled me.
In each room stood a great table, 011 which
the presents were arranged, amid flowers and
wreathes. From the center rose the beautiful
Christmas tree covered with wax tapers to the
very top, which made it nearly as light as
day, while every bough was hung with sweet-
meats and gilded nuts. The children ran
shouting around the table, hunting their pres-
ents, while the older persons had theirs pointed
out to them. I had quite a little library of
German authors as my share3 and many of
the others received quite valuable gifts.

But how beautiful the beart-felt joy that

glorious feast, this Christmas time! What a
chorus from happy hearts went up on that even·

and glad associatione, it is here anticipated
with joy, and leaves apleasant memory behind
it. We may laugh at such simple festivals

some of these beautiful old customs were better

BEDOUIN LOVE SONG.

ROM the desert I come to thee,
On a stallion shod with fire ;
And the winds are left behind
In the speed of my desire.
Under thy window I stand,
And the midnight hears my cry :
I love thee, Ι love but thee!
With a love that shall not die
Till the sun grows cold‚
And the stars are old,
And the leaves of the Judgment
Book unfold!

Look from thy window, and see
My passion and my pain!

I lie 011 the sands below,
And I faint in thy disdain.

Let the night-winds touch thy brow
With the heat of my burning sigh,

 

And melt thee to hear the vow
Of a love that shall not die
Till the sun grows cold‚
And the stars are old,
And the leaves of the Judgment
Book unfold!

My steps are nightly driven,
By the sever in my breast,
To hear from thy lattice breathed
The word that shall give me rest.
Open the door of thy heart,
And open thy ehamber door,
And my kisses shall teach thy lips
The love that shall fade no more
Till the sun grows cold‚
’ And the stars are old,
And the leaves of the Judgment
Book unfold 1

 

THE LONG AGO.

H 1 a wonderful stream is the river of Tim 1
O As it runs through the realm of te· 1’3·
With a faultless rhythm and a mus ic· al
rhyme
And a broader sweep and a surge sublimo, ‚
As it blends 111 the ocean of years!

 

How the wiuters are driftin g like flakes of snow
And the summ 013 like birsd between,
And the years in the sheaf, how they come andi
they go
And the riv 013 breast, with its cbb and its flow

As it glides 111 the shadow and sheen. 1
