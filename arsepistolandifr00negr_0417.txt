A YAOHTSMAN’S SPEEOH.
FROM “OCEAN-BORN.”

“ AM an old salt, called upon to speak for
that saline institution without any-
without any—an y—(talces from lexis breast

pocket a paper,wltic·h he uoifolds, ylcmeinq ner-

vously at the ‘lvritinq upon it) preparati0n3 I

find my stomaeh—niy stomneh——no—(takes

the paper from his pocket (md ylanoes «rt sit) my
heart-I find my beart too full for ntteranee.

I am not the first old salt to whom the atten-

tion of the people 1166 beon directed. There

was another old salt, sir, first in war—first in

—in—(eonsultinq the paper) peace-first in

peace, and first in the arts of seainanship

and navigation.

“Proudly I point to that first old salt in
the history of—the history of—-of (the paper)
the United States. You know him well, Mr.
Commodore. His name was George-George
-his name was George-Gem-ge (the paper)
WVashington—George NVashington. He stood
at the helm of the ship of—the ship of-of-
(the φαμεν) state; 1116 ship of state, Mr. Coni-
modore. In other words, sir, he took his
trick at the wheel. He navigated that ship
as no other man could navigate her, sir. He
knew when to takea 1661ι in the skysail-boom l
He knew when to top up the flukes of the
main-royal mudhook! He knew just how
much the foreto'—bobbin-stay would bear, and
he didn’t burst it!

“He sailed that ship of state with the jib-
stay fast 16 1116 1)61ν]1116-1111611, with the jib-
1661( swelling in the breeze, and the sky-
serapers hauled taut 611 1116 weather-staysnil
sheets! He kept her head south east by no'th,
and the grand old craft bowled along like a
white cloud through the azure of the eanopy
below— Below‘? (the φαμεν) above him; the
eanopy above him, Mr. Commodore; or like
the ship of the desert over the burning sands
of the straits of Magellan!

“I was speaking of the ship of state, that
gallant old craft, lifting here foreto’-gallant
cutwater 16 1116 breezes wish her main royal
hatchway braced sharp up, and the bilge
water flying like corn in a pareher. I was

speaking of the skipper of that eraft; of that
old salt George—George-George——I nien-
tioned the nume—George—(tlte popm)—
lVashington 3 George lVashing‘ton.

“ He saved the ship! With his little han-,hot
116 eut away the 11661116, 1161161616, lwwsprits,
beekets, bo's'ns, 61111 1111111111166, and brought
the old craft safe into 1)(»11161111-Ρ611161111 2²——
into—into (the paper) port; into port. But,
Mr. (10111n1‹1›dm·0‚ Ι was about to allude to
other distinguished old 66116, who have honored
the profession 16 which I belong.

“There was 6116 down in Tennessee, who
navigated that 661116 6111 ship of state. He
was a tough specimen of the old salt. He
kept his backstay brace-d shssrp up into 1116
eye of the wind. 116 was tough ns the. foi-eto*-
mainmast of a man-of-war l Sometimes they
called him Old—Old Hiekups—*Hioknps⁴?
(tlte paper) Old Hiekory! They called him
so, Mr. (Jonnnodore, because he was fond of
peanuts! His name was Andrew—An‹lrew——
Andrew—-Andrew Johnson! His 1161116 was
Andrew Johnson, Mr. Connnodore. (Tho
proper) Jaekson, ΜΓ. Commodorel His name
was Andrew Jackson! He was the captain
of his ship, sir. Δ11711611 116 was siek, 116 knew
enough to heave to, sir. NVhen South Caro-
lina wanted to nullify, 116 knew enough to lie to,
sir. In this respo-rt, 61 r, 116 was different from
George——George (Nee paper) XVashingtom
George XVashingtvn, sir.

‘⁶ History solemnly reeords that G. W.
couldn’t tell a-—a—-tell a—a——a——(the paper)
6 116 ; 61111 Andrew ,Im-kson could lie to, 61111
pour his 116611111ηῆΓ gons into the nullifiers, like
6 brave old salt as 116 was, But, Mr. Com-
modore, time would fail 1116, and you r patience
give out, before I eonld allude to all the old
salts to whose honored profession Ι belong;
and I 6611 only mention Gener-al Phil—Phil
—General-Phil-Phil--Qhe paper) 811611-
(1611; Phil Sheridan, who rode at 61161161· 61
winchester down 16 1116 battle-field, and made
a good run of it.''
