70 RICHARD HENRY STODDARD.

Though rather for your sake than mine. ι The endiess ehb and flow of things,

A long and honorable line The rush of 'Pime's resistless wings!

Is yours -the Peerage of the l‘en, Nothing? One thing, and not in vain,
Founded when this old world was young, One thing remains: Letters remain !
And need was to preserve for men Your art and mine, yours more than mine,
(Lost else) what had been said and sung, Good follows of the lettered line,

Tales our forgotten fathers told, To whom Ι owe this Curtain Call,

Dimly remembered from of old, I thank you all, I greet you all.

Sonorous cantieles and prayers,
Serviee of elder gods than theirs
Which they knew not; the epie strain
Wherein dead people lived again 1

Noblesse oblige! But while Ι may,
Another word, my last, maybe:
WVhen this life-play of mine is ended,
And the blaek eurtain has deseended,

A long, unbroken line is ours; Think kindly as you can of me,

It has outlived whole lines of kings. And say, for you may truly say,

Seen mighty empires rise and fall “This dead player, living, loved his part,
And nations pass away like flowers-- And made it noble as he could,

Ruin and darkness cover all! Not for his own poor persona] good,
Nothing withstands the stress and strain But for the glory of his art! ’'

 

BURIAL OF LINOOLN.

EAGE! Let the long prooession come, Peacel Let the sad procession go,

Forhark1—the1mu1mffil, muffled drum, While eannon boom, and hells toll slow ς
The trumpet’s wail afui-3 And go, thou sacred car
And see! the awful ear! Bearing our woe afar!
Go, darkly borne, from State to State, Yes, let your tears indignant fall,
WVhose loyaL sorrowing cities wait But leave your muskets on the wall ;
To honor all they can, Your country needs you now
The (lust of that good man l Beside the forge, the plough! f
Go, grandly borne, with such a train So sweetly, sadly, sternly goes ‘3
As greatest kings might die to gain ; The fallen to his last repose. ⁴⁴:
The just, the wise, the brave Beneath no mighty dome, J
Attend thee to the grave! But in his modest home,
And you, the sohliers of our wars, The ehurohyard where his children rest, ἑ
ssronzed veterans, grim with noble sears, The quiet spot that suits him best, ,-
Salute him once again, There shall his grave be made,
Youi= late commanda—slahins And there his bones be laid l
And there his eounfirymen shall come, For many a year :md many an age,
With momory promi, with pity (lumb, While history on her ample page
And strangers far and near, The virtues shall enroll

For many and many a year! Of that paternal soull
