WILLIAM CULLEN B RvANT. 33

“ The groves were God's first temples. Ere man learned
To hew the shaft, and lay the archim-ave,

And spread the roof above them—ere he framed
The lofty vault, to gather and roll back

The sound of anthems; in the darkling wood,
Amid the cool and silence, he knelt ‹lown

And offered to the Mightiest solemn thanks
And supplication. For his simple heart

Might not resist the sacred influences,

thich, from the stilly twilight of the place,

, And from the gray old trunks, that high in heaven
Mingled their mossy boughs, and froin the sound
Of the invisible breath that swayed at. once
All their green tops, stole over him, and bowed
His spirit with the thought of boundless power,

, And inaccessible majesty.''

Mr. Bryant removed to New York City in 182 5, and became, in 1826,
one of the editors of the “Evening Post,⁷' which he continued to edit
with great ability till his death. A collection of his poenis was published
in 1832. He visited Europe in 1834 and returned in 1836, and in 1849
travelled in Egypt and Syria. His letters from abroad, contributed to
the ‘³ Evening Post,'’ were collected into book form as “ Letters of a
Traveller.'' Subsequent to 184 5 he resided at Roslyn, on Long Island.
As editor of the “ Evening Post '' he gave a high tone to that journal,
opposed the extension of slavery, advocated every measure which
thoughtful and wis'e men considered to be advantageous to the public
welfare, never descended to abuse or villification of any rival or competi-
tor, showed himself to be a gentleman of the most perfect type, and at
the close of his long career had gained a fame which a distinguished
statesman said he would rather have than that of any other living man.
He died June 12, 1878.

“No poet,” says Griswold, “has described with more fidelity the
beauties of the creation, nor sung in nobler song the greatness of the
Creator. He is the translator of the silent language of the universe to
the world. His poetry is pervaded by a pure and genial philosophy, a
solemn and religious tone, that influence the fancy, the understanding
and the heart.'‘ Says Professor Wilson, “All will agree with what
Washington Irving has said of his friend—that his close observation of
the phenomena of nature and the graphio felicity of his details, prevent
his descriptions from becoming general and connnonplace.'’

The writer of this heartfelt tribute to the genius of Bryant remem-

bers seeing him at an advanced age. and was struck with his quiet dignity
