146 JAMES PARTON.

became a popular and well-known author, and was engaged to write
statedly for Robert Bonner's “Ledger'’ and “Youth‘s Companion.”
These publications were greatly enriched by the charming products of
his pen.

His last work was a “ Life of Voltaire.'' His aim was to present the
great Frenchman 111 1115 true character and soften down some of the
aspersions which had been falsely cast upon his name, but the work did
not meet with the success of some of his previous publications, owing
perhaps to the fact that the subject was a foreigner, and owing perhaps,
still further, to the fact that the subject was Voltaire. In 1855 Mr. Par-
tou married Sarah Payson Eldredge, formerly Miss Willis, a sister of
N. P. Willis, who had been once married, her husband having died 111
1846. This gifted lady was known under the nom de plume of Fanny
Fern, whose sketches and piquant thoughts enj oyed an almost phenome-
nal popularity. Mr. Parton died October 17, 1891.

 

THE DUEL BETWEEN HAMILTON AND BURR.
FROM “LIFE OF AARoN BURR.”

EW of the present generation have stood
upon the spot, which was formerly one
of the places that strangcrs were 51116 10
visit on coming to the city, and which 1116
events of this day rendered forever memor-able.
Two miles and a half above the city of Ho-
boken, the heights of VVeehawken rise, in the
picturesque form so familiar to New Yorkers,
to an elevation of a hundred and fifty feet
above the Hudson. These heights are rocky,
very steep, and covered with small trees and
tangled bushes. Under the heights, at 3
point half 3 mile from where they begin, there
is, twenty feet· above the water, 3 grassy ledge
or shelf, about six feet wide, and eleven paces
long. This was the fatal spot. Except that
it is slightly encumbered with underbrush, it
is, at this hour, precisely what it was on 1116
11111 of July‚ 1804.

For the very purpose of preventing sus-
picion, it had been arranged that Colonel
Burr's boat should arr1ve some time before
the other. About half past six, Burr and
Van Ness lauded, and leaving their boat 3
few yards down the river, ascendes] over the

 

 

rocks to 1116 appointed place. It was a warm,
hright, July morning. The sun looks down,
‹lirectly after rising, upon the VVeehawken
heights, and it was for that reason that the ’
two men removed their coats before the 31·-
rival of the other party. There they stood
carelessly breaking away the branches of the
underwood, and looking out upon as fair, ae
various, 35 animated, 35 beautiful a scene as
11101131 eyes in this beautiful world ever be·

11811113111111011511031 was seen to approach. A

sew minutes before seven it touched the rocks,
and Hamilton and his second aseended. The '
principals and seconds exchanged the usual
salutations, and the seconds proceeded imme-
diately to make the usual preparations. They
measured ten full paces ; then cast lots for the
choice of position, and to decide who should
give the word. The lot, in both cases, fell to
Genera] Hamilton‘s second, who chose the
appar eud of the edge for his principal, which,
31 11131 110111 of the day, could not have been
the hest, for 1116 1635011 11131 1116 morning sun, ,ι

and the flas-hing of the river, would both inter· ¹
