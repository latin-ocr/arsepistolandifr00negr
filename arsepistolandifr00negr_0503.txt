FAVORITE POEMS AND PROSE SELECTIONS. 455

There was little wool, there was little food; For which she dreamed and for which she
Oh, bare, indeed, was the pantry shelf ! sehemed, [wife.
Since he took no heed to another’s need, then consenting to be Farmer Grudges'

So he was warm and well fed himself. ‚
But Farmer Grudge not an meh would budge

The wife, it is true, would skimp and serew, From the path his penurious father trod ;

 

Piece and pateb, and some way plan, But though very rich would work in a diteh;
As woman will, with amazing skill, All day, and at dusk in a corner nod,
Who is tied for life to a stingy man ; And his girls and boys, bereft of the joys
But, oh, how she sighed for the things T hat others had, were disposed to roam,
denied 1 And to spend profuse, nor put to use
The books, and comfort, and lai-ger life The lessons they had been taught at home.
OPPORTUNITY.
BY CLARA J. DENTON.
SEED came floating near me, And then the plant beholding,
A brown and paltry thing, My tcars fell freely down,
It seemed an idle past-ime The seed was O, so paltry,
To stay its hasty wing. And light as thistle down.
But low ! my neighbor graspfd it, thy was there none to whisper,
And 'neath her watehful care, ‘⁴ ‘Tis opportunity! ’'
It grew and gave her freely The bloom and fragrance yonder
A wreath of blossoms rare. Would then have been for me.

THE OLD GONTINENTALS.

BY GUY HUMPHREYS MACMASTER.

Born at Clyde, New York‚ in 1829 ; graduatcd at Hamilton College‚ 1847 ; lawyer, and
judge of Steuben County, New York3 wrote “Carmen Belioosum; ’' died 111 1887.

N their ragged regimentals Then with eyes to the front all,
Stood the old Continentals‚ And with guns horizontal‚
Yielding not, Stood our 51105 ;
WVhen the grenadiers were lunging, And the balls whistled deadly,
And like hail fell the plunging And in streams flashing redly
Cannon-shot ; Blazed the fires;
WVhen the files As the 1031·
Of the isles, On the shore,
From the smoky night enemupment, bore the Swept the strong battle—breakerso’er the green-
banner of the rampant sodded acres
Unicorn, Of the plain3
And grummer, grummer, grummer, rolled the And louder, louder, louder craoked the black
roll of the drummer, gunpowder,

Through the morn! Oracking amain!
