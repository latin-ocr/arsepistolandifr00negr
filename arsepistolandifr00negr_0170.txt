130 GEORGE BANCROFT.

posed to devote himself to literature and learning, and cherished dreams
of successful authorship. His first book was a small collection of Poems‚
chiefly illustrative of his experiences and observations abroad, which
appeared in 1823.

Soon after this he opened the Round School at Northampton, Mass.,
and devoted himself assiduously to teaching. He now began to give more
attention to politics, first as a Whig and then as a Democrat. In 1834
Mr. Bancroft published the first volume of his History of the (301011123ῒίοη-
of the United States, which was everywhere received with the liveliest
applause. The reputation which he acquired by this and other literary
labors, and the ability he exhibited as a politician, commended him to the
notice of the dispensers of place and patronage in KVashington, and he
was appointed to the lucrative post of Collector of Customs at Boston.
His official duties did not divert him from his studieS, and in 1837 he
gave to the press the second and in 1840 1110 third volume of his History,

In 1845 Μ1. Bancroft was called into the Cabinet of President Polk
as Secretary of the Navy. He resigned in 1846 and was appointed Min--
ister Plenipotentiary to Great Britain, a position which he filled with dis-
tinguished ability until 1849. Α period of retirement from public life
followed his return to America. In the Civil &Var he was heartily in
accord with our national government, and 111 1867 was appointed by Presi-'
dent Johnson Minister to Berlin, serving with much honor to his country .
until recalled at his own request in 1874. He died January 17th‚ 1891. v

Mr. Bancroft's monumental work is “The History of the United
States,'' in ten volumeS. This from every point of view is a masterly
production. A volume of his “ Miscellanies '’ appeared in 18 5 5; “Α1)1·3-
ham Lincoln,'' a memorial addi-ess delivered before Congress, in 18663
and “Joseph Reed‚” a historical essay, appeared in 1867. Several other
works of minor importance were the products of his prolific pen, all dis·
tinguished by the engaging style, the profound thought, and the historical
accuracy which have characteriZed all his writings. In all of his public·
life he exhibited a remarkable wisdom, courage and far-sightedness.

An English critic describes Bancroft's History as one of “ great
research, while the author states his own opinions decidedly and strongly,
the whole being pervaded by a fair and just spirit. The style is vigorous‚
clear and frank, not often rising into eloquence‚ but frequently pictur-
esque, and always free from imitation and from pedantry. It is in fac
what it professes to be—a national work, and is worthy of its great theme.”'
