JOHN GREENLEAF -wfflrrffln 95

his works are not without passages scarcely less distinguished for tender-
ness and grace. In his later poems his style is more subdued and correct,
. though it is divested of none of his peculiar freshness.

Besides his “ Mogg Megone‚’' “ Ballads,'' ‘⁴ Lays of Home,'' “ Bridal
of Pennacook‚'‘ and other poemS, he wrote the “ Legends of New Eng-
land,'' before mentioned, “The Stranger in Lowell,'' and much more in
prose, all in the same honest and fearless spirit which marks his verse.

Whittier was a humanitarian3 he was a firm believer in the father-
hood of God, beautifully expressed in the lines :

Ι know not where His islands list
Their fronded palms in air ;

But this I know, I cannot drift
Beyond His love and care.

Through all his life, whether with the bright, flashing blade of his
noble, poetic rhetoric, or the sounding quarter-staff of his earnest and
manly prose, he fought the long, hot, dangerous battle of emancipation
through contempt and defeat to lasting and complete victory. Whittier
never was married but devoted his life to his one great pursuit. In 1840
he settled in the quiet village of Amesbury, Mass, near his birthplace‚
where he died September 7, 1892.

A final edition of Whittier's poems revised by himself, appeared in
seven volumes (1888-89). A new volume, “ At Sundown,'’ was announced
after his death. Whittier may reasonably be styled a national poet. His
works breathe affection for and faith in our republican polity and un-
shackled religion, but an affection and a saith that do not blind him to
our weakness or wickedness. He dares to “tell the world it lies.'' He
is of that class of authors whom we most need in America to build up a
literature that shall elevate with itself the national feeling and character.

IN SGHOOL DAYS.

TILL sits the school-house by ¹the road, The chareoal freseoes on its wall ;
A ragged beggar sunning3 Its door's worn sill, betraying
Around it still the sumaehs grow. The feet, that, creeping slow to school,
And blackberry vines are running. Went storming out to playing.
within, the master’s desk is seen, Long years ago a winter sun
Deep scarred by raps official; Shone over it at setting ;
The warping fioor, the battered seats, Lit up its western window-pnnes,

The jack-knife's carved initial; And low eaves’ icy fratting.
