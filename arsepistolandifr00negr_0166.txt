126 HELEN HUNT JACKSON.

for some time, cancer then developed and she died August 12, 1885. Lov-
ing hands made her grave in Colorado, and according to her expressed
wish, she was buried on the peak that looks down into Cheyenne Canyon.
This was a spot she loved. In a cabin below she had lived, and had passed
some of the happiest days of her life. There in the quiet and solitude
of the mountains she retired from the gaze of the world, and there she
wished to rest when her pen was palsied.

In addition to “Verses by H. H.,'’ already referred to, she wrote
“ Bits of Travel'’ (1873); “ Bits of Talk about Home Matters'' (1873),
“ Sonnets and Lyrics ’' (1876); “ Mercy Philbrick's Choice '' (1876);
“ Hettie's Strange History'' (1877); “ A Century of Dishonor'’ (1881);
“ Ramona '’ (1884), an Indiau story. In addition to these works she
was the author of several popular juvenile books. She wrote two novels
in the “ No Name '' series, which attracted much attention at the time of
their publication. There appeared in one of our magazines several
fascinating, delightful stories under the pen name of “ Saxe Holme.''
Although it has never been authoratively stated that she was the author,
these charming stories have generally been attributed to her.

SPINNING.
IKE a blind spinner in the sun, My threads will have; so from the first,
I tread my days; Though blind, Ι never felt accurst.
I know that all the threads will run
Appointed ways; I think, perhaps, this trust has sprung
I know each day will bring its task, From one short word
And, being blind, no more I ask. said over me when Ι was young,-
1 do not know the use or name SO young, Ῑ heard
Of that Ι spin : It, knowing not that God's name signed
Ι only know that some one came, My brow, and sealed me his, though blind.

And laid within
My hand the thread, and said, ‘¹ Since you But whether this be seal 01· sign
Are blind, but one thing you can do.'' Within, without,

Sometimes the threads so rough and fast It matters Ποῖ· The hond divine

And tang-led ΗΥ, Ι never doubt.

Ι know wild storms are sweeping past, I know he set me here’ and Stffl’

And fem, that I And glad, and blind, Ι wait his will;
Shall fall ; but dare not try to find But listen listen day by day
A safer place, since I am blind. ' ΤΟ hgin„ their thrgad
Ι know not why, but I am sure tho bear the finished web away,
That tint and place, And cut the thread,
In some great fabric to endure And bring God’s message· in the sun,

Past time and racc, “ Thou poor blind spinner, work is done.”
