ELIZABETH OAKES SNmH.
Writer of Fiction and Verse.

¹* ³ ἢ WRITER of both verse and prose and with equal facility appar-
ently in each, Mrs. Smith has long been favorably known to

the reading public. She is quick to catch the signs of any new
and philanthropic effort intended to elevate woman and benefit
society. Of good old Puritan stock on both sides of her ances—

In speaking of her one author says, “ Her productioris are character-
ized rather by a passionate and lofty imagination, than by fancy, and by
a subtle vein of philosophy more than by sentiment, though in the latter
she is by no means deficient.'' She contributed in early life poenis and
prose pieces to various periodicals after the custom of her time, and was
not known by her real name until long afterwards.

She was born in Cuniberland, near Portland, Metine, on August 12,
1806. Her maiden name was Prince, and at an early age she was mar-
ried to Mr. Seba Smith, who was engaged in newspaper work. Mr.
Smith was a man of excellent literary ability, and under the pen-name
of “Jack Downing'' he gained a national reputation. It is undoubtedly
true that he was greatly assisted in his labors by his talented wife.

Mrs. Smith's poetic romance entitled “The Sinless Child‚'' was first
published in the “Southern Literary Messenger.'⁷ This work brought
her at once into prominence, opened the way for the exercise of her lit-
. erary inclinations, and the reputation she had already gained was main-
tained and enhanced by other productions following rapidly from her pen.
Her first published work, “ Riches Without Wings,‘’ was issued in 1838.
She removed to New York with her husband in 1842 and soon afterward
Δ published a novel entitled “The WVestern Captive,'’ and also a singular

tale entitled “The Salamander3 a Legend for Christmas.'' -

Her versatile pen was also turned in the direction of tragedy, and
she was the author of “The Roman T ribute, a Tragedy in Five Acts,''

which was founded on the historic event of Constantinople being exempted
