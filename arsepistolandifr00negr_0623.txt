Ffflcm DoRoTHEA HEMANS.
Celebrated Poetess

f, ,ng HIS poetess was born at Liverpool, September 25, 1793. Her
'⁸' father, George Browne, was a Liverpool merchant, of Irish
extraction3 her mother, whose maiden name was Wagner, was
of mixed Italian and German descent. Felicia was distin-
guished for her beauty and precocity, and at an early age she
manifested a taste for poetry, in which she was encouraged by
her mother. Family reverses led to the removal of the Brownes to
Wales, where the young poetess imbibed a strong passion for nature,
read books of chronicle and romance, and gained a working knowledge of
the German, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese langnageS.

She also cultivated her excellent musical taste. Her first volume
was published in 1808, when she was only fifteen years of age, and
contained a few pieces written about four years earlier. Her second,
entitled “The Domestic Affections,'' appeared in 1812.

In the same year she married Captain Hemans of the F ourth Regi-
ment, whose health had suffered in the retreat on Corunna, and afterward
in the Walcheren expedition, and who settled in Italy in 1818. After
this time they never met agaiu3 their marriage was understood not to
have been happy. MrS. Hemans, though in poor health, now devoted
herself to the education of her children, to reading and writing, and spent
the rest of her life in North Wales, Lancashire, and later at Dublin,
where she died May 16, 1835.

Mrs. Hemans, without great originality or force, is yet sweet, natural
and pleasing. But she was too fluent and wrote much and hastily3 her
lyrics are her best productions3 her more ambitious poemS, especially her
tragedies, being, in fact, quite insipid. Stssl, she was a woman of true
genius, though her range was circumscribed, and some of her little lyrics,
“The Voice of Spring,'' “The Better Land,’' “The Graves of a House-

hold,'' “The Treasures of the Deep,'’ and “The Homes of England‚‘' are
perfect in pathos and sentiment, and will live as long as the English lan-

guage. These are found in almost every school collection, and this early
