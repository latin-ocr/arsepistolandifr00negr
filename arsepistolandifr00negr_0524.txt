MAN WAS MADE TO MOURN.

Gilbert Burns, the brother of the poet, says: “He (Burns) used to remark to me that he
could not well conceive a more lnortifying picture of human life than a man seeking work.
ln casting about in his mind how this sentiment might be brought forward, the elegy, ⁴ Man
was Made to Mourn,' was colnposed.”

IIEN chill N ovvmher's surly blast Or haply, prest with cares and woeS,
W Made fields and forests bare, Too soon thou hast began
One eveniug‚ :is Ι wandered forth, To wander forth, with me, to mourn

Along the bunks of Ayr, The miseries of man !
Ι spied a man, whose aged step
Seenied weary, worn with care;
His face was furrowed o‘er with years,
And hoary was his hair.

‘¹ The sun that overhangs yon moors,
Outspreading far and wide,
Where hundreds labor to support
A haughty lordling's pride—

“ Young stranger, whither wanderest thou ἶ) ” I’ve seen yon weary winter sun
Began the reverend sage ; Twice forty times return ;
“ Does thirst of wealth thy stop constrain, And every time has added proof

Or youthful pleasurc’s rage‘? That man was made to mourn.
