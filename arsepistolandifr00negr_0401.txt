his father’s plantation, and while preparing for college, and after his
removal to Cambridge, no books gave him 50 11111011 pleasure as the most
marvellous and terrible creations of the imagination. At Newport he
became acquainted with Malbone, the painter, and was thus, perhaps, led
to the choice of his profession. He began to paint in 011 before he went
to Cambridge, and while there divided his attention between his pencil
and his books.

Upon being graduated he returned to South Carolina, to make
arrangements for prosecuting his studies 111 Europe. He had friends
