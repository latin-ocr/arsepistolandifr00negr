Press on l if fortune play thee false
'Po-day, to-morrow she’ll be true ;

thom now she sinks, she now exalts‚
Taking old gifts and granting new.

The wis-dom of the present hour
Makes up for follies past and gone ;

To weakness strength succeeds, and power
From frailty springs——Press on ! P REss ΟΝ l

Press on l what though upon the ground
Thy love has been poured out like rain?
That happiness is always found
The sweetest that is born of pain.

FAVORITE POEMS AND PROSE SELECTIONS.

Ost mid the forest’s deepest glooms,

A bird sings from some blighted tree ;
And iu the dreariest desert blooms

A never dying rose for thee.

Therefore, press on 1 and reach the goal,
And gain the prize, and wear the crown3
Faint not! for to the steadfast soul,
Come wealth and honor and renown.

To thine ownself be true, and keep

Thy mind from sloth, thy beart from soil; ’

Press on! and thou shalt surely reap

A heavenly harvest for thy toil.

THE LIGHT OF KNOWLEDGE.
BY ELIHU BURRITT.

He acquired the title of the “Learned Blaclzsmith,’' on account of having a command ¹
of nearly thirty languages, a knowledge of which 110 acquired at the forge and during hours

when he was not at work.

He was a prominent supporter of the Peace Society and other ¹

reforms. His first work, called “ Sparks from the Anvil,’' was followed by others, including 2
his lecturos and speeches‚ and accounts of his travels. Born in N ew Britain, Connecticut, in

1810, and died March 6, 1879.

NOWLEDGE cannot be stolen from you.

It cannot be bought or sold. You may

110 poor, and the sheriff come into your

house, and sell your furniture at auction, or

drive away your cow, 01· take your lamb, and

leave you homeless and penniless; buthe can-

1101 lay the law's hand upon the jewelry of

your mind. This cannot be taken for debt:

neither can you give it away, though you
give enough of it to fill a million minds.

I will tell you what such giving is like.
Suppose, now, that there were no sun nor stars
in the heavens, nor anything that shone in
the black brow of night; and suppose that a
lighted lamp were put into your hand, which
would burn wasteless and clear ainid all the
tempests that should lirood upon this lower
world.

Suppose‚ next, that there were a thousand
millions of human beings on the earth with
you, each holding in his hand an unlighted
lamp, filled with the same 011 as yours‚ and
capable of giving as much light. Suppose
these millions should come, one by one, to you
and light each his lamp by yours‚ would they
rob you of any light? Would less of it shine

on your path? would your lamp burn more
dimly for lighting a thousand millions?

Thus it is, young friends. In getting rich
in the things which perish with the using, men
have often 011ογοἀ 10 1110 letter that first com-
mandment of selfishness: “Keep what you
can get, and get what you can.'' In filling
your minds with the wealth of knowledge,
you must reverse this rule, and obey this law:
“ Keep what you give, and give what you can.'’

The fountain of knowledge is filled by its
outlets, not by its inlets. You can learn
nothing which you do not teach ; you can
acquire nothing of intellectual weahah, except
by giving. In the illustration of the lamps,
which Ι have given you, was not the light of
the thousands of millions which were lighted
at yours as much your light, as if it all came
from your solitary lamp? Did you not dispel
darkness by giving away light?

Remember this pai-able, and, whenever you
fall in with an unenlightened mind in your
walk of life, drop a kind and glowing thought
upon it from yours‚ and set it a-burning in the
world with a light that shall shine in some
dark place to beam on the benighted.
