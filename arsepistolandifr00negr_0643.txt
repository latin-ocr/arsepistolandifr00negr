lived for a year in France. In 1795 he was put in easy cir-

sister at Grassmere and traveled a great deal on the continent and in
Scotland. He was visited by Coleridge, and the two were strong admirers
and close friends. He recei‘.÷·c- the honor of appointment as poet laureate
in 1843.

beauty and ge.⁴ tle spirit.. Five years later he published “ Lyrical Bal-

exponent of a school, whose characteristic was sympathy with and inter-
pretation of nature. “The Excursion’' and “The Prelude'' are two of
his best offorts, but his “Ode on Immortality'' is his most celebrated

production.

THE TRAVELLER’S DOG.

BARKING sound the Shepherd hears With something, as the shepherd thinks,
A cry as of a dog or fox ; UUUSURJ in itS 01¹5 ἱ

He halts, and searohes with his eyes Nor is there any one in sight
Among the scattered rocks; All round, in hollow or ou height;
⁷ And now at distance can diseern Nor shout nor whistle strikes his ear.
A stirring in a brake of fern ; that is the creature doing here ?
And instantly a dog is seen,
Glaneing through that covert green. Ῑῑ was a COVQ a 11ng PCCQSS»
That keeps, till June, December’s snow ξ
The dog is not of mountain breed ; A lofty precipiee in front,
Its motions, 1:00, are wild and shy‚- A silent tarn below!
