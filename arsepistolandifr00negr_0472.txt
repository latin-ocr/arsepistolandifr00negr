And the mingling of their voices
Made the harmony profound
Till the quiet street of Chestnut

Through all its lengthy line,
As the boy beside the portal
Hastens forth to give the sign 1
With his little hands uplifted,
Breezes dallying with his hair,
Hark! with deep, clear intonation,
Breaks his young voice on the air:

Hushed the people’s swelling murmur,
Whilst the boy criesjoyously ;

The old bellman lifts his hand,

Forth 110 sends the good news, making
Iron musio through the land.
