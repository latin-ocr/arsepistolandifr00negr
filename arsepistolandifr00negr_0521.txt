Rossfflw BURNS.

Scotland's Sweetest Bard

     

w· quUDGED by the hold an author has upon the public, including

i both the educated and refined and persons of ordinary attain
ments, Burns has few, if any, superiors. His verse, which is
purely Scottish, flavored with the scenery of his native land
and with his own characteristics, mental, moral and social, is
so human, so simple, so frank and captivating that it touches
the popular heart more profoundly perhaps than the lyrics of any 011101·
poet. He wrote himself into his songs and it is impossible to separate
the one from the other. His poems have a peculiar charm. It is not the
grand march of a Byron's genius, nor the profound intellectual grasp of
Tennyson, nor the finished beauty of Longfellow, but in the delightsul

expression of sentiments and feelings common to all readers, Burns is

 

without a rival.
The greatest lyric poet Scotland has produced was born at Alloway,

near Ayr, January 25, 1759, and died at Dumfries, July 21, 1796. Burns
was of hnmble descent, his ancestors for generations being Scottish
farmers, and he remained 10 1110 end 1110 bard of the common people. His
education was meagre and, in conjunction with 1115 brother Gilbert, he, in
1783, rented a farm at Mossgiel and began life as a farmer. His ventures,
however, like those of his father, were unfortunate, and this, in part, led
him to publish his poems. Although 311 uncultivated countryman, with
the meagre education that nearly always accompanies abject poverty, he
had brain and culture enough to fairly 0511111310 1115 own work, He did
not need to go to school 10 discover that he was a poet.

His first volume of poems, some of which were written in the field,
was published at Kilmarnock in 1786, on which occasion he changed the
family name from Burness 10 Burns. The volume brought him fame,
and in the same year 110 went to Edinburgh, where he became something
of a literary lion. In 1787, a second edition of his 11001115 was published

by Creech in Edinburgh.

The following year he married Jane Armour and took a farm 31 Ε1115-
