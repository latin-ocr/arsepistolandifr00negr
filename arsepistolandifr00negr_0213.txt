JAMES GILLESPIE BLAINE.

His countrymen were thrilled with instant,
profound and universal sympathy. Master-
ful in his mortal weakness, he became the
centre of a nation's love, enshrined in the
prayers of a world.

But all the love and all the sym pathy could

not share with him his suffering. He trod
¹ the winepress alone. With unfaltering front
he faced death. With unfailing tenderness
he took leave of life. Above the demoniac
hiss of the assassin’s bullet he heard the voice
of God. With simple resignation he bowed
to the divine decree.

As the end (116117 11661 1115 early craving for
the sea returned. The stately mansion of
power had been to him the wearisome hospital
of pain, and he begged to be taken from its
prison walls, from its oppressive, stifling air,
from its homelessness and its hopelessness.

11016 the pale sufferer to the longed·for heal-
ing of the sea to live or to die, as God should
will, within sight of its heaving billows‚ within
sound of its manifold voices.

With wan, fevered face tenderly lifted to
the cooling breeze he looked out wistfully upon
the ocean's changing wonders ; on its far 56115,
whitening the morning light; on its restless
waves, rolling shoreward to break and die
beneath the noonday sun ; on the red clouds
of evening, arching low to the horizon; on
the serene and shining pathway of the stars.
Let us think that his dying eyes read a mystic
meaning which only the rapt and parting soul
may know. Let us believe that in the silence
of the receding world he heard the great
waves breaking on a farther shore, and felt
already upon his wasted brow the breath os
the eterna-l morning.

STRENGTH OF THE REPUBLIO.
FROM “TWENTY YEARs OF coNGREss.”

T needs no argument to show that the cen-
1161 clement of the stability of this system
of American republics was the strength

of the Federal Union, its growth into a har-
monious nationality, and its ability to prevent
anywhere on the two continents the armed
intervention of foreign Powers for the purpose
of political domination. This strength was
known and this resolution pnblicly declared,

audit is safe to affirm that before 1861 or after.

1865 not one nor all of the European Powers
would have willingly challenged this policy.

But the moment the strength of the Union
seemed weakened, the moment that the lead-
ing Republic of this system found itself 116111-
pered and embarrassed by internal dissen-
sions, all Europe—that Europe which upon
the threatening of a Belgian fortress, or the
invasion of a Swiss canton, or the loss of the
key to a church in Jerusalem, would have
· written protocols‚ summoned conferenceS, and
,mustered armies—quietly acquiesced in as
wauton, wicked, and foolish an aggression as
ever Imperial folly devised.

The same monarch who appealed with eon-

 

fidence to Heaven when he declared war to
prevent a Hohenzollern from ascending the
throne of Spain, appealed to the same Heaven
with equal confidence and equal success when
he declared war to force a Hapsburg upon
the throne of Mexico.

The success of the establishment of a For-
eign Empire in Mexico would have been fatal
to all that the United States cherished, to all
that it hoped peacefully to achieve. The
scheme of invasion rested on the assumption
of the dissolution of the Union and its divis—
ion into two hostile governments; but asido
from that possibility, it threatened the United
States upon the most vital questions.

It was at war with all our institutions
and our habits of political life, for it would
have introduced into a great country on this
continent, capable of unlimited development,
that curious and mishcievous form of govern-
ment, that perplexing mixture of absolutism
and democracy—imperial power supported by
universal suffrage-which seems certain to
produce aggression abroad and corruption at
home.
