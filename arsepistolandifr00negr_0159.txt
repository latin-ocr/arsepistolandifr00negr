JAMES RussELL LOWELL. 121

tion which he held about five years—and under his auspices this maga-
zine acquired a wide and deserved popularity.

Among his noteworthy poetical productions we may mention “ Under
the Willows, and other Poems'' (1869), and ί( Τ116 Cathedral’' (1870)-
Besides the various collections of his poems referred to above, he pub·
lished several volumes of his prose wrstings, entitled “ Among My Books'’
(1870), second series (1876) and “My Study Windows ’' (1871).

Among the poets of America‚ Lowell is distinguished by the great
range, as well as by the versatility‚ of his powers. He seems equally at
home in the playful‚ the pathetic, or the meditative realms of poetry.
And we always rise from the perusal of his productioris with the impres-
sion that he has not put forth all his strength, but that something still
higher would not have been beyond the reach of his genius.

In 1877 he was appointed United States minister to Spain, and from
1879 until his removal by President Cleveland in 1885 he was minister to
England. In 188 3 he was chosen lord rector of St. Andrew's University‚
and while in England he received the degree of LL. D. from the Universi-
ties of Oxford‚ Cambridge and Edinburgh. Died August 12, 1891.

In 1844 Lowell married Maria Whste, a lady of singular beauty and
poetic temperament, who was also an ardent abolitionist. It is commonly
admitted that she greatly influenced his political sentiments. She died 111
18 5 3, 011 the same night in which a daughter was born to Longfellow⁷ who
was a friend and neighbor of Lowell. This incident was celebrated by
Longfellow in the following lines which he sent to his friend:

“ 'Twas at thy door, O friend, and not at mine
The angel with the amaranthine wreath‚
Pausing, demanded, and with voice divine
Uttered a word that had a sound like death.

“ Then fell upon the house a sudden gloom‚
A shadow on those features fair and thiu,
And slowly‚ from that hushed and darkened room,
Two angels issued, where but one went in.

“Angels of life and death alike are His3
Without His leave, they pass no threshold o’er:
Who then would wish, or dare, believing this,
Against His messengers to shut the door? ”

Lowell's last work is entitled “ Latest Literary Essays and Addres-
ses.'’ It was issued in 1891, after his death.
