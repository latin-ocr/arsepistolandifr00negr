ripened into the warmest friendship. On the 29th of February, 1812,
appeared the first two cantos of “ Childe Harold,'' and the success and
sale of the work was instantaneous. The hero, a proud but melancholy
wanderer, satiated with sensual pleasures‚ was at once recognized as a
delineatiou of the noble author, notwithstanding his decisive denial. The
“Giaour‚’' the “ Pride of Abydos,'' and the “Corsair,'' poems, in all of
which the author displayed his unrivalled talents, and accurate knowl-
edge of eastern customs and manners, followed at short intervals, Of
one of these 20‚000 copies were sold in one day. On the 2d of January,
> 1815, Byron married Miss Milbanke‚ daughter of Sir Ralph Milbanke.
The marriage was unhappy‚ and after 'various quarrels, and much dis-

tress, the parties separated.

After a residence in 1taly‚ where his dramas, and many poems were
written, and where he was alternately dissolute and temperate, the revo-
lution in Greece engaged his attention, and he determined to embark his
person and fortune in the cause of liberty. He was received in Greece
with enthusiasm, and proceeded to Missolonghi, where his reception was
most gratifying to his feelings. He immediately formed a brigade of 500
Sutiotes. He was aware of the dissensions existing among the Greeks,
but was confident of their ultimate success. He was urged to go to
Zante‚ on account of the unhealthiness of Missolonghi. “ Ι cannot quit
Greece,’' he wrote to a friend, “while there is a chance of my being even
of (supposed) utility.'’

On the 9th of April, while riding on horseback, he was overtaken by
a rainstorm‚ and the feverish cold he took was the precursor of a fatal
malady. He died April 19th, 1824; his last thoughts, as his words in-
dicated, were with his wife and child. His body was conveyed to Eng-
land, and interred at Hucknall church‚ near Newstead Abbey. The in-
terior of the coffin bore the following inscription:
