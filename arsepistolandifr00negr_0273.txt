JOHN LOTHROP MOTLEY. 225

Armada by which the Spanish project for subj ugating England and
reconquering the Netherlands was finally defeated.

This work, which was on a somewhat larger scale than the preced-
ing, embodied the results of a still greater amount of original research.
By two new volumes published in 1868 the work was brought down to the
twelve years' truce in 1609. Meanwhile Motley from the close of 1861
to 1867 had held the post of United States Minister at Vienna3 in 1869
he was appointed to a similar position at the Court of St. James, but was
recalled in 1870. After a short visit to Holland he again took up his
residence in England‚ where “The Life and Death of John Barneveld‚ ·
Advocate of Holland, with a view of the Primary Causes of the Thirty
Years' War,'' appeared in two volumes in 1874. Ill health now began
to interfere with sustained literary vigor and he died at Dorchester‚ Dor-
setshire‚ on May 29, 1877.

The merits of Motley as a historiari are undeniably great3 he has
told a story of a stirring period in the history of the world with full
attention to the character of the actors and strict fidelity to the numer-
ous vivid details of the action. But it may safely be said that his tale is
best where most unvarnished, and probably no writer of the same rank
has owed less to the mere sparkle of highly polished liter-ary style.

END OF THE SIEGE OF LEYDEN.

EYDEN was relieved. The quays were
lined with the famishing population‚ as
the fleet rowed through the canals,

every human being who could stand, coming
forth to greet the preservers of the city. Bread
was thrown from every vessel among the
crowd. The poor creatures who, for two
months, had tasted no wholesome human food,
and who had literally been living within the
jaws of death, snatched eagerly the blessed
gift, at last too liberally bestowed. Many
choked themselves to death, in the greediness
with which they devoured their bread3 others
became ill with the effects of plenty thus sud-
denly succeeding starvation 3—but these were

isolated cases, a repetition of which was
prevented.

The Admiral, stepping ashore, was wel-

comed by the magistracy‚ and a solemn Ἴ

procession was immediately formed. Magis-
trates and citizens, wild Zeahmders, emaciated
burgher guards, sailors‚ soldiers, women,
children—nearly every living person within
the walls, all repaired without delay to the
great church‚ stout Admiral Boisot leading
the way, The starving and heroic city, which
had been so firm in its resistance to an earthly
king, now bent itself in humble gratitude
before the King of kings. After prayers,
the whole vast congregation joined in the
thanksgiving hymn. Thousands of voices
raised the song, but few were able to carry it
to its conclusion, for the universal emotion‚
deepened by the music, became too full for
utterance. The hymn was abruptly sus-
pended, while the multitude wept like chil-
dren.

This scene of honest pathos terminated‚ the
