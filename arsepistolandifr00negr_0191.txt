fere with the sight. The pistols were then
loaded, and the principals placed, Hamilton
looking over the river toward the city, and
Burr turned toward the heights, under which
they stood. As Pendleton gave Hamilton his
pistol, he asked,

“ Will you have the hair-spring set? ''

“ Not this time‚” was the quiet reply.

Pendleton then explained to both princi pals
the rule which had been agreed upon with re-
gard to the firing ; after the word present, they
were to fire as soon as they pleased. The
seconds then withdrew to the usual distance.

“ Are you ready? ’' said Pendleton.

Both auswered in the affirmative. A mo-
ment's pause ensued. The word was given.
Burr raised his pistol, took aim, and fired.
Hamilton sprang upon his toes with a convul-

sive movement, reelcd a little toward the
heights, at which moment he involuntarily
discharged his pistol, and then fell forward
headlong upon his face, and remained mo-
tionless on the ground. His ball rustled
among the branches, seven feet above the
head of his antagonist, and four feet wide of
him. Burr heard it, looked up, and saw
where it had severed a twig. Looking at
Hamilton, he beheld him falling, and sprang
toward him with an expression of pain upon
his face. But at the report of the pistol, Dr.
Hosack‚ Mr. Davis and the boatman hurried
anxiously up the rocks to the scene of the
duel; ancl Van Ness, with presence of mind,
seized Burr, shielded him from observation

with an umbrella, and urged him down the
steep to the boat.

OLD VIRGINIA.

LD VIRGINIA is a pathetic chapter iu
political economy. OLD Virginia, in-
deed! She reached decrepitude while

contemporary communities were enjoying the

first vigor of youth3 while New York was

executing the task which Vir ginia’s Geoige
WVashington had suggested and fmetold, that
of connecting the waters of the great lVest
with the sea3 while New England was career-
ing gayly over the ocean, following the whale
to his most distant retreat, and feeding belli-
gerent nations with her superabundance. One
little century of seeming prosperity; three
generations of spendthrifts3 then the lawyer
and sheriff! Nothing was invested, nothing

saved for the future. There were no manu-
factures, no commerce, no towns, no internal

trade, no great middle class,

As fast as that virgin richness of soil could
bc converted into tobacco and sold in the
London docks the proceeds were spent in
vast, ugly mansions, heavy furniture, costly
apparel, Madeira wine, fine horses, huge
coaches and more slaves. The planters lived
- as though virgin soil were revenue‚ not capi-
tal. They tried to maintain in Virginia the
lordly style of English grandees wrrHoUT

 

any Birmingham, Staffordshire, Sheffield or
London docks 1ο pay for it. Their short

lived prosperity consisted of three elements ‚——
virgins soil, low· -priced slav eS‚ high· -priced to-
bacco.

The virgin soil was rapidly exhausted3 the
price of neg roes was always on the increase;
and the price of tobacco was always tending
downwaid Their sole chance of founding a
staple commonwealth was to inv est the pro-
ceeds of their tobacco 111 something th at would
absorb their labor and yield them plofit when
the soil would no longer produce tobacco.

But their lahorem were ignorant slaves, the
possession of whom destroyed their enm-gy,
swelled their pride, aud dulled their under-
standings. Vir-ginia’s case was hopeless from
the day 011 which that Dutch ship landed the
first twenty slavcs; and, when the time of
reckoning came the people had nothing to
show for their long occupatiori of one of the
finest estates in the world, except great hordes
of negroes, breeding with the rapidity of rab-
bits; upon whose annual increase Virginia
subsisted, until the most glorious and benefi-
cial of all wars set the white race free and
gave Virginia her second opportunity.
