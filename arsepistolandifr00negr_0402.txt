3:34 WASHINGTON ALLSTON.

last-mentioned year, his wife died, very suddenly 3 and the event, induc-
ing the deepest depression and melancholy‚ caused a temporary suspen-

sion of his letters.
ln 1818 he accompanied Leslie to PariS‚ and in the autumn of the

following year came back to America, having been previously elected au
associate of the English Royal Academy. In 1830 he married a sister
of Riehard H. Dana, and the remainder of his life was tranquilly passed
at Cambridgeport, near Boston‚ where he was surrounded by warm and
genia] friends, in assidnons devotion to his art. He died very suddenly,

on the night of the eighth of July, 1843.
As a painter Allston had no superior, perhaps not an eqnal, in his

age. He differed‚ from his eonteinporarieS‚ as he said of “Monaldi‚'' ἒ

“ no less in kind than in degree. lf he held anything in common with
others, it was with those of ages past, with the mighty dead of the fifteenth
century. From them he had learned the language of his art, but his
thoughts, and their turn of ekpression were his own.'’ Among his prin-
cipal works are *⁸ The Dead Man Restored to Life by Elisha 3 ” the “Angel
Liberating Peter from Prison 3 '' “Jacob's Dream3 '' “ Elisha in the Desert;''
the “¹ Triumphant Song of Miria1n3’' “The Angel Uriel in the Sun ; '’
‘⁶' Saul and the Witch of Endor ; ’' “ Spalatro's Vision of the Bloody
Hand;” “Gabriel Setting the Guard of the Heavenly Host3 ” “Anne
Page and Slender ;‘' “Rosalie3‘' “Donna Mareia in the Robber's Cave;''
and ¹¹ Belshazzar’s Feast‚ or the Handwriting 011 the Wall.'’ He had
been engaged twenty yearS, off and on. in developing his sublime con-
ceptions of this Biblical scene, and left it unfinished at his death.
