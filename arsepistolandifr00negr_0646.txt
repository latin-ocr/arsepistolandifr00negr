Poet Laureate of England.

if?

30, 1835. Α1 1110 age of eighteen he graduated from the Uni-

. ,⁹¹⁶1 versity of London, and in 1857 was called to the bar. From

 

1870 to 1883 110 was prominently identified with journalism‚
representing the London “Standard'' at Rome during the
session of the Ecumenical Council in 1870, and at the head-

quarters of William 1., during the Franco-Prussian War. On the estab-
lishment of the “National Review'' in 1883, 110 was placed in editorial
control. His claim to fame, however, rests chiefly upon his work as a ⁴

poet.

After the death of Lord T ennyson, the Marquis of Salisbury, then
Premier, offered him the post of poet laureate‚ which he accepted. The
appointment caused not a little surprise, and provoked more or less
hostile comment. Austin is a brilliant conversationalist and a highly ,
prized guest at social gatherings‚ although at times is inclined to be
brusque. His verse is uniformly good or bad, and it contains enough of ι
both merit and demerit to account for the contrary opinions held of his j

poetic talent.

TOGETHER..
DEDICATED wrrH wARMEsr SYMPATHY 'ro THE AMERIOAN PEOPLE.

WHO say we cherish far-off feud,

Still nurse the ancient grudges?
Show me the title of this brood
Of sels-appointed judges;

Their name, their race, their nation, elan,

And we will teach them whether
We do not, as none others ean,

F eel, think, and work together!

Both speak the tongue that Milton spoke,

Shakespeare and Chatham wielded,
And Washington and all his folk
When their just claim was vielded.

111 11 both lisp, both learn, both pray,
Dirge death, and thus the tether‚
Grows tighter, tenderer, every day,

That binds the two together.

Our ways are one, and one our aim,
And one will be our story,

Who fight for Freedom, not for fame,
From Duty, not for glory ;

Both stock of the old Home, where blow
Shamrock, and rose, and heather,

And every year link arms and go
Through its loved haunts together.
