WltLlAM EWART GLADsToNE.

Eminent Statesman and Author.

δ’ sd ORE than any other ruler, whether of royalty or the people,
Ι Mr. Gladstone swayed the destinies of the British Empire.
Laws were enacted, measures in Parliament were adopted and
'⁷ ’ national policies were framed and executed either by his
direct advocacy or by his permission. He possessed the
power of commanding intellect, scholarship, oratory, and a
firnmess in conscientious conviction that could no more be shaken than
the rock of Gibralter. He was manifestly born to be a leader.

ΜΓ. Gladstone may be called the most eminent English statesman,
orator, and author of the last century. He was born in Liverpool in
December, 1809, and graduated at Oxford in 1831, having gained the
highest distinction in classics and mathematiCS. He was elected to
Parliamentby the Conservatives in 1832, and appointed a lord of the
treasury by Sir Robert Peel in December, 1834.

From this time on Mr. Gladstone advanced steadily from one position
to another until he was chosen to the very responsible office of Chancellor
of the Exchequer in the Cabinet of Lord Palmerston. From being a
Conservative Mr. Gladstone gradually adopted Liberal opinions and
principles until in 1868 he became Primc Minister. His speeches and
orations in Parliament and out were the wonder and admiration of even
his opponents. He contemplated great nleasures for the welfare of his
country, including the extension of the suffrage, the formation of public
schools and the disestablishment of the Irish Ch‘urch.

Mr. Gladstone was preeminently a scholar, and through all his long Δ
and distinguished career he found time to indulge in authorship‚ some of
his published works showing the marked ability which characterized him
as a statesman and orator. He passed into a ripe old age laden with
honors, and died May 16, 1898. It is enough to say that Mr. Gladstone
must be named in that bright galaxy of distinguished men which includes
our own XVebster and Clay, while in some respects he is easily superior

to every other statesman and orator the century produced.
