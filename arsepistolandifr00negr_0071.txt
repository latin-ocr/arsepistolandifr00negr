EAGH IN ALL.
LITTLE thinks in the field yon red-cloaked Had left their beanty on the shore,

clown
Of thee from the hill-top looking down ;
And the heifer that lows in the upland farm
Far heard, lows not thine ear to 61161111 ;
Τ116 sexton tolling his bell at 110011

ι Dreams not the great Napoleon

Stops his horse, and lists with delight,

117111151 1115 files sweep round yon Alpine height ;
Nor knowest thou what argument

'l'hy life to thy neighbor’s creed hath lent,

All are needed by each one;

Nothing is fair or good alone.

I thought the sparrow's note from heaven,
Singing at dawn 011 1116 alder bough;

Ι brought him home in 1115 11651 61 even—
He sings the song, but it pleases not now,

For I did not bring home the river and sky,

He sang to my ear, these sang to my eye.

The delicate 5116115 lay on the shore—

The bubbles of the latest wave

Fresh peals to their enamel gave,

And the bellowing of the savage sea

Greeted their safe escape to me.

I wiped away the weeds and foam,

Ι fetched my sea-born treasnres 1101116,

But the poor, unsightly, noisome things

With the sun, and the sand, and the wild nproar·
Nor rose, nor stream, nor bird is fair,
Their concord is beyond compare.

The lover watched his gracefnl maid
As mid the virgin train she strayed
Nor knew her beauty's best 611116
11765 woven still by that snow-white ouire.
At last, she came to his hermitage,
Like the bird from the woodlands to {ne cagam-
The gay enchantment 1165 undone—
A gentle wife, but sairy 110116.
Τ11611, Ι said, “ Ι 601161 truth ;
Beauty is unripe childhood's cheat ;
Ι leave it behind with the games of youth ; '⁹
As Ι spoke, benenth my feet
The ground-pine curled its pretty wreath,
Running over the hair-cap burs:
1 I inhaled the violet's breath :
¹ Around me stood the oaks and firs:
Fine-eones and acorns lay on the ground.
Over me soared the eternal sky
Full of light and of deity;
Again I saw—again Ι heard,
The 10111118· river, the morning bird ε
Beanty through my senses stole-—

 

l Ι yielded myself to the perfect whole.

“GOOD BYE, PROUD WORLD1‘’

OOD-BYE‚ proud world! I’m going
Thoiitaliitii’noe my friend; I am not
111116;

Too long through weary crowds I roam-
A river ark 011 1116 066611 brine,

Too long I am tossed like driven foam,

But now, proud world, I'm going home.

Good-bye to Flattery's sawning face;
To Grandeur with 1115 wise grimace:

To upstart Wealth 5 averted eye:

To supple office, low and high ;

To crowded halls, to court and street,
Το frozen hearts, and hasting feet,

To those who go, and those who come—

Good-bye‚ proud world, I'm going home.

Ι 80 10 seek my own hearth-stone
Bosomed in yon green hills alone3

A secret lodge in a pleasant land,

11711056 groves the frolic sairies planned,
11711616 6161165 green, the livelong day
Echo the blackbird’s ronndelay‚

And evil men have never trod

A spot that 15 sacred to thought and GOD.

O, when I am safe in my sylvan home,
I mock at the pride of Greece and Rome;
And when Ι 6111 strete-hed beneath the pines
11711616 the evening star so holy shines, ,
Ι 1611811 61 1116 1016 and pride of man,
At the sophist 56110015, 611(1 1116 learned elan ;
For what are they all 111 their high conceit,

1 When man in the bush with God may meet?
