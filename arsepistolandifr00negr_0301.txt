GEORGE PERKINS MORRIS. 253

My father read this holy book Thou truest friend man ever knew,
To brothers, sisters, dear; Thy constancy I've tried ε

How calm was my poor mother's look, When all were false, I found thee true,
Who loved God's word to hear! My oounsellor and guide.

Her angel face—I see it yet! The mines of earth no treasures give
What thronging memories come! That could this volume buy;

Again that little group is met In teaching me the way to live,
Within the halls of home! It taught me how to die!

WOODMAN, SPARE THA'I' TREE.
W OODMAN, spare that tree! When but an idle boy

Touch not a single bough! Ι sought its grateful shade;
In youth it sheltered me, In all their gushing joy
And I’ll protect it now. Here too my sisters played.
'T was my forefather’s hand My mother kissed me here;
That placed it near his cot3 My father pressed my hand—
There‚ woodman, let it stand, Forgive this foolish tear,

Thy axe shall harm it not! But let that old oak stand!
That old familiar tree, My beart-strings round thee cling,
Whose glory and renown Close as thy bark, old friend!

Are spread o’er land and sea, Here shall the wild-bird sing,
And wouldst thou hew it down? And still thy branches bend,
Woodman, forbear thy stroke! Old tree! the storin still brave!
Cut not its earth—bound ties3 And, woodman, leave the sp0t;
Ο, spare that aged oak‚ While I've a hand to save,
Now towering to the skies! Thy axe shall hurt it not.

 

THE PASTOR’ S DAUGHTER.

N ivy-mantled cottage smiled, One balmy eve in dewy spring
Α Deep-wooded near a streamlet's side, A bard became her father's guest ;
NVhere dwelt the village pastor’s child, He struck his harp, and every string

In all her maiden bloom and pride. To love vibrated in her breast.
Proud suitors paid their court and duty With that true saith which cannot falter,
To this romantio sylvan beauty: Her hand was given at the altar,
Yet none of all the swains who sought her, And faithful was the heart he brought her
Was worthy of the pastor's daughter. To wedlook and the pastor's daughter.
The town-gallants crossed hill and plain, How seldom learn the worldly gay,

To seek the groves of her retreat, With all their sophistry and art,
And many followed in her train, The sweet and gentle primrose-way

To lay their riches at her feet. To woman's fond, devoted heart:
But still, for all their arts so wary, They seek but never find the treasure,
From home they could not lure the fairy. Although revealed in jet and azure.

A maid without a heart, they thought her, To them, like truth in wells of water,
And so they left the pastor’s daughter. A fable is the pastor’s daughter.
