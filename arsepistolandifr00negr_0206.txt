RETURN OF GOLUMBUS.
FROM “FERDINAND AND ISABELLA.‘’

ΗΕ admiral was too desirous of presentin g
himself before the sovereigns, to protract
his stay long at Palos. He took with

him on his journey specimens of the multifari-
ous products of the newly-discovered regions.
He was accompanied by several of the native
islanders‚ arrayed in their simple barbaric cos-
tume, and decorated, as he passed through the
principa] cities, with collars, bracelets‚ and
other ornaments of gold, rudely fashioned.
He exhibited also considerable quantities of
the same metal in dust, or in crude masscs,
numerous vegetable exotics‚ possessed of aro-
matic or medicinal virtue, and several kinds
of quadrupeds unknown in Europe, and birds
whose variety of gaudy plumage gave a bril-
liant effect to the pageant. The admiral's
progress through the country was everywhere
impeded by the multitudes thronging forth to
gaze at the extraordinary spectacle, and more
extraordinary man, who, in the emphatic lan-

guage of that time, which has now lost its 1

force from its familiafity, first revealed the
existence of a “ New World.”

As he passed through the busy, populous
city of Seville, every window, balcony, and
housetop, which could afford a glimpse of him,
is described to have been crowded with specta-

 

tors. It was the middle of April before ἶ
Columbus reached Barcelona. The nobilityv -
and cavaliers in attendance on the court, ξ
together with the authorities of the city, came ⁸
to the gates to receive him, and escort him to 1
the royal presence. F erdinand and Isabella s
were seated, with their son, Prince John, ,⁸
under a superb canopy of state, awaiting his 1
arrival. On his approach, they rose from 1
their seats, and, extending their hands to him ἐ
to salute, caused him to be seated before them. ⁴:
These were unprecedented marks of conde· ἵ
scemion, to a person of Columbus’s rank, in ¹
the haughty and ceremonious court of Castile. ,¹³
It was,indeed, the proudest moment in the life* V
of Columbus He had fully established the· ⁴
truth of his long-contested theory, in the face ·
of argument, sophistry, sneer, skepticism‚ and
contempt. He had achieved this, not by
chance, but by calculatiou, supported through .
the most adverse circumstances by consum-
mate conduct.

The honors paid him, which had hitherto 1
been reserved only for rank, or fortune, or
military success, purchased by the blood and l
tears of thousands‚ were, in his case, a homage
to intellectual power successfully exerted in 1
behalf of the noblest interests of humanity.

HE troops, refreshed by a night’s rest,
succeeded, early on the following day,
in gaining the crest of the sierra of

AhualcO‚ which stretches like a curtain be-
tween the two great mountains on the north
and south. Their progress was now compara-
tively easy, and they marched forward with a

buoyant step as they felt they were treading
the soil of Montezuma.

They had not advanced far, when, turning ⁴3
an angle of the sierra, they suddenly came on ἰ
a view which more than compensated the toils ι
of the preceding day. It was that of the Val- Q

ley of Mexico, which, with its picturesque l
