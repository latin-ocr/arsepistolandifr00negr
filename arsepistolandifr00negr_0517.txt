ALFRED TENNYSON.

Saw the heavens fill with eommeree, argosies
of magio sails‚

Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down
with costly bales;

Heard the heavens fill with shonting‚ and
there rained a ghastly dew

From the nations' airy navies grappling in the
eentral blue;

Far along the world-wide whisper of the
south-wind rushing warni,

With the standan-ds of the peoples plunging
through the thunder-storm;

Till the war-drum throbbed no longer, and the
battle-flags were furled
In the parliamenta of man, the federation of

the world.

There the common sense of most shall hold a
fretful realm in awe,

And the kindly earth shall slumber‚ lapt in
universal law.

So I triumphed ere my passion sweeping
through me left me dry,

Left me with the palsied beart, and left me
with the jaundieed eye ;

Eye, to which all order festers, all things here
are out ofjoint.

Science moveS, but slowly, slowly, creeping 011
from point to point:

Slowly comes a hungry people, as a lion’
creeping nigher, ”

Glares at one that nods and winks behind a
slowly dying fire.

Yet Ι doubt not through the ages one increas-

ing purpose runs,
And the thoughts of men are widened with

the process of the 511115.

What is that to him that reaps not harvest of
his youthful joys,

Though the deep heart of existence beat for-
ever like a boy's!

Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers3 and I
linger on the shore,

And the individual withers‚ and the world is
more and more.

Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and he
bears a laden breast,

F ull of sad experieuee moving toward the
stillness of his rest.

Hark! my merry comrades call me, sounding
011 the bugle horn—

They to whom my foolish passion were a tar-
get for their scorn ;

Shall it not be seorn to me to harp on sueh a
mouldered sti-ing?

I am shanied through all my nature to have
loved so slight a thing.

XVeakness to be wroth wit-h weakness! wo-
man's pleasure, woman’s pain—
Nature made them blinder motions bounded

in a shallower hrain ;

lVoman is the Iesser man, and all thy pas-
sions, matehed with mine,

Are as moonlight unto sunlight, and as wat-er
unto wine——

Here at least, where nature sickens, nothing
Ah, foi· some retreat

Deep in yonder shining orient, where my life
began to beat!

NVhere in wild Mahratta·battle fell my father,
evil-starred ;

Ι was lest a tranipled orphan, and a selfish
uncle’s ward.

Or to burst all links of habit—there to wandel·
far away,
On from island 111110 island at the gateways of

the day—-

Larger constellations bui-ning, mellow 11100115
and happy skies,

Breadths of tropio shade and palms in clnster,
knots of Paradise.

Never comes the trader, never floats an
European flag—

Slides the bird o'er lustrous woodlund, droops
the trailer from the crag—

Droops the heavy-blossomed bower, hangs the
heavy-fruited tree—

Summer isles of Eden lying in dark-purple
spheres of sea.
