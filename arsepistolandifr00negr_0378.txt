OME out and walk, Mary; we shall
have full twenty minutes. The
conductor says fifteen, and you may

be sure we shall not start till two.''

Mary was glad enough to join him. As
5116 crowded by the stove and porter’s seat, at
the end of the car, she proposed that he
should ask little Black Ribbons to join them,
and he did so. He went back to the place
where Black Ribbons was sitting alone,
touched his hut, and said, ‘· My wife is going
to take a walk 011 the platform. Will you
not join us? ''

They had exchanged civilities with Black
Ribbons before, but she was shy. They were
happy in the joy of their wedding journey.
Her seat was “three,'' quite at the end of
the Pullman, and theirs was “twenty-one to
twenty-four,” quite at the other. Mary had
offered her cold coffee at lunch and she had
declined. The walk, therefore, was the first
successful effort at anything like intimacy.

“ Look therc,’' said Hector, and he kicked
with his foot an ingot of silver which lay as
heavy and motionless under the bloxv as if it
had been spiked to the plank on which they
stood. “If we were dishonest, we could
hardly get that off-—all three of us. And
now the expressmen leave these three blocks,
trusting not in our honesty, not 111 law or
sheriff, not in any All-Seeing Eye, but simply
111 the dead weight of silver. That is the way
of the world '’

“The way of what world. ‘²⁷'

“The way of this world. What I mean is
that heavy people and things—people with
much specific gravity—are let alone and pros-
per, as if dead weight were a merit, while
light anda airy 13e0121e⁰like 115 three, and elegant
things like that silver when it shall have been

 

 

 

drawn into threads, and moulded into butter-
flies for breast-pins, have to be watched and
tended and daintily lifted from place to place.
Now, there is our Caesar Ganymede, the Pull-
man porter, sadly looking upon you now, he
is so afraid you will be left, Mary.''

“You would like to go as freight?'’ said
Mary.

“ Not quite that. For then they would lay
me on my back, and put two tea-chests on
me, and a log of red-wood on them, and these
ingots of silver on them, and lock the car
door for ten days.’'

‘⁶ You would arrive breathless‚ like a mes-
senger in a novel.’'

“ Yes, and my clothes would need brushing.
But we might all three have been sent, not as
freight, but as parcels‚ by Adams’ Express.
We could have been tied up in brown paper,
like dolls. They could have marked 115,
‘ This side up with care.' We should go by
‘ great speed ' as they say in France. We
should not have to pay a cabman when we
arrived in columbus, and we should have to
spend at the 11166116, 611 1116 money these
blessed through tickets have eost us.'’

“ Minus what we paid the expressman.’'

“ No, madam. For that we have provided
independently. For the hard-earned specie
which I gave to yonder bloated conductor for ,
our Pullman Section, and which our friend
here has pam. for hers, would more than satisfy =
the greed of the express company. I am tall 1

« but thin. I should not measure more than

six cubic feet. I should first tie up both you ⁴
l·idies back to back, and you would not 1
together measure more than eight feet. It 1s ff

not too late now. I will go and speak to the i
express agent.''
