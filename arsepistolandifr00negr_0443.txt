BUDGE’S VERSION OF THE FLOOD.
FROM “HELEN⁷s immas„

HAT asternoon Ι devoted to making a powered natural depravity‚ and Toddie mur-

bouquet for Miss Mayton, and a most

delightful occupation Ι found it. It
was no florist's bouquet, composed of only a
few kinds of flowers, wired upon sticks, and
arranged according to geometric pattern. Ι
used many a rare flower, too shy of bloom to
recommend itself to florists3 Ι combined tints
almost as numerous as the flowers were, and

perfiimes to which city bouquets are utter
strangers.

Atlength it was finished, but my delight
suddenly became clouded by the dreadful
thought, “that will people say ?’' Ah! Ι
had it. I had seen in one of the library-
drawers a small pasteboard box, shaped like
a bandbox3 doubtless that would hold it. Ι
found the box ; it was of just the size I needed.
I dropped my cardinto the bottom—no danger
of a lady not finding the card accompanying
a gift of fiowers—neatly fitted the bouquet in
the center of the box, and went in search of
Mike. He winked cheeringly as I explained
the nature of his errand, and he whispered:

“ I'll do it as clane as a whistle,yer honor.
Mistress Clarkson’s cook an mesilf understand
each other, an' I’m used to goin' up the back
way. Niver a man cau see but the angles,
an' they won't tell.''

“ Very well, Mike ; here’s a dollar for y0u;
you'll find the box on the hat—rack‚ in the
hall.'’

Toddie disappeared somewhere, after sup-
per, and came back very disconsolate.

“ Can’t find my dolly's k'adle,'’ he whined.

“ Never mind, old pet‚'' said I, soothingly.
‘⁴ Uncle will ride you on his foot.'’

“But I want my dolly's k’adle,'' said he,
piteously rolling out his lower lip.

“ Don't you want me to tell you a story ?”

For a moment Toddie’s face indicated a
terrible internal conflict between old Adam
and mother Eve; but curiosity finally over-

mured :

“ Yesh.'’

“ What shall Ι tell you about ?''

“ ’Bout Nawndeark.”

“ About what ,⁹ ’'

“ He means Noah an’ the ark,'' exclaimed
Budge.

“ Datsh what I shay—-Nawndeark‚” de-
clared Toddie.

“ Well,'' said I, hastily refreshing my mem-
ory by picking up the Bible—for Helen, like
most people‚ is pretty sure to forget to pack
her Bible when she runs away from home for
a few days—“ well, once it rained forty days
and nights, and everybody was drowned from
the face of the earth excepting Noah, a right-
eous man, who was saved with all his family,
in an ark which the Lord commanded him to
build.''

“ Uncle H arry‚’' said Budge, after eon-
templating me with open eyes and mouth for
at least two minutes after I had finished, “ do
you think that's Noah ⁴? ''

“ Certainly, Budge3 here's the whole story
in the Bible.”

“ well, I don't think it's Noah one single
bit‚’' said he, with increasing emphasis.

“ I’m beginning to think we read different
Bibles, Budge 3 but let's hear your version.''

“ Huh ?'’

“ Tell me about Noah, if you know so much
about him.'’

“ Ι will, if you want me to. Once the Lord
felt so uncomfortable cos folks was bad that
he was sorry he ever made anybodysor any
world or anything. But Noah wasn't bad;
the Lord liked him first-rate, so he told Noah
to build a big ark, and then the Lord would
make it rain so everybody should be drowned
