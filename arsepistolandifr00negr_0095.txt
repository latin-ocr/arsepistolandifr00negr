RICHARD HENRY STODDARD. 69

The gods give as but gods may do;
We count our riches thus—
· They gave their richest gifts to you,
And then gave you to us.
Mr. Stoddard, who at that time was seventy-five years old, replied to
the congratulatione of his admirers in one of the following poems, ‘⁶ Α

Curtain Call‚’' plainly showing that his hand had not forgotten its cunning.

 

THE SEA.

HROUGH the night, through the night, Through the night, through the night,
In the saddest un rest, Where the sea lifts the wreck,
Wrapt in white, all in white, Laud in sight, close in sight,

With her habe on her breast On the surf-fiooded deck

Walks the mother so pale, Stands the father so brave,

Staring out on the gale Driving on to his grave
Through the night! . Through the night l

A OURTAIN OALL.

ENTLEMEN : If Ι have any right And this assumption of his part,

To come before you here to-night Ι might pretend to drop a tear,

It is conferred on me by you, And lay my hand upon my heart
And more for what Ι tried to do And say Ι could not speak‚ because
Than anything that Ι have done. I felt so deeply your applause!

A start, perhaps, a race not won l Ι cannot do this, if Ι would ;
But ’tis not wholly lost, Ι see, Ι can but thank you, as Ι should,
For you, at least, believe in me. And take the honors you bestow—

A largess, not a lawful claim ;
Comrades, nay, fellows, let me say, My share thereos is small, I know,
Since life at most is but a play, But from your hands to-night is sdmew
And we are players, one and all, A precious crown in these pert dag. s

And this is but a curtain call, Of purchased or of self-made bays ,ss
If Ι were merely player here, Yon give it-—I receive it, then,
