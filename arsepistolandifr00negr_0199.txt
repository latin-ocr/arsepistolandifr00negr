OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES. 1:33

Thanks for the heavenly masseage brought by Build 11199 more stately mansione, O my 110111,

 

thee, Ι Ae the ewift 39390113 1011 1
child of the wandering soe, 1 Leave thy low-vaulted par—‚tl
Cast from her lap, forlorn! i Let each new temple, nobler than 1119 last,
· From thy dead lips a clearer note is born ξ Shut 11199 from heaven with a dome more
‚ Than ever Triton blew from wreathed horn! ' vast,
While on mine ear it rings, 1 Till thou at length art free,
Through the deep caves of thought I hear a Leaving 1111119 outgrown s-shell by life’s 11111991-
voice that singu :—- ing sea!
KATYDID.
LOVE to hear thine earneet voioe, Ι think 111919 ’13 a knot os you
Wherever thou art hid, Beneath the hollam 1199-
Thou testy little dogmatist, A knot of spinster Katydids—
Thou pretty Katydid ! Do Katydids drink tea?
Thon mindest me of gentlefolks—
Old gentlefolks are they— Ο tell me where did Katy live,
Thou say'st 311 undisputed thing And what did Katy do?
In meh a solemn way, And 1133 she very fair and young,
And yet so wicked too?
'finon art 3 female, Katydjd ! Did Katy love 3 naughty 111311,
1 know it by the trill Or kias more cheeks than one?
‘that quivere through thy piercing notes, I warrant Katy did 110 111019
So petulant, and shrilL Than many 3 Κ319 has done.

AUNT TABI'I'HA.

HATEVER I do and whatever I say, If the men were εο wicked—rll ask my papa
W Aunt Tabitha tells that isn’tthe way, λ How he dated to propose to my derling

When she was 3 girl (forty summers mama?

But Aunt Tabitha tells me, they didn’t do so.

How wicked 119 319, and how good they were ; A martyr will save us? and nothing else
