54 RALPH WALDO EMERSON.

They colored the whole horizon round, Out of that delicate lay couldst thou

Stat-s {lamed and faded as they bade, Its heavy tale divine.
All echoes hearkened for their sound,

They made the woodlands glad or mad. u GO' lonely man’„ lt Sffltb‘

‘¹ They loved thee from their birth,
I touch this flower of silken leaf ’ Their hands were pure, and pure their saith,
Which once our childhood knew, There are no such hearts on earth.

Its soft leaves wound me with a grief “Ye ὀΐων one mother‚s milk
›

WVhose balsain never grew. One chamber held ΥΘ all,
Hearken to yon pine warbler, A very tendet ⁴history
Singing alost in the t··ee; Did in your childhood fall.

Hearest thou, O travellerl

that he qiu “Ye cannot unlock your heart,
ι r geth to nie?

The key is gone with them ;
Not unless God made sharp thine ear The silent organ loudest chants
With sorrow such as mine, The master’s requiem.'’

ι-,“,-

ΤΗΕ AMULET.
YOUR picture smiles as first it smiled ;

The ring you gave is still the same ;
Your letter tells, oh changing child!
No tidings since it came.

 

Red when you love, and rosier red,
And when you love not, pale and blue.

 

Alas! that neither bonds nor vows
Can certify possession :

’ Ι Torments me still the sear that love
Died in its last expression.

Give me an amulet
That keeps intelligence with you—

THE TRUE HERO.

WELL for the fortunate soul Him duty through the clarion calling
Which Music’s wings unfold, To the van called not in vain.
Stealiug away the memory
of sorrows new and old!

Yet happier he whose inward sight,
Stayed on his subtle thought,

Shuts his sense on toys of time,

To vacant bosoms brought.

Stainless soldier on the walls,
Knowing this,—and knows no more,—
Whoever fights, whoever falls,

J ustice conquers evermore,

J ustice after as before 3—

And he who battles on her side,

God, though he were ten times slain,

Crowns him victor glorified,

He Wl¹0⁷ in GVH· time& · Victor over death and pain
&Varned by an lnward vo1ce,

Heeds not the darkness and the dread,
Biding by his rule and choice‚

Telling only the fiery thread,

Leading over heroic ground

Walled with immortal terror round,
To the aim which him allures, · He, the poor for whom angels foil,
And the sweet heaven his deed secures, Blind with pride and fooled by hate,
Peril around all else appalling, lVrithes within the dragon coil,
Cannou in front and leaden rain, 1 Reserved to a speechless fate. q

But best befriended of the God

Forever: but his erring foe,
Self-assured that he prevails,
Looks from his victim lying low,
And sees aloft the red right arm
Redress the eterna] scales.
