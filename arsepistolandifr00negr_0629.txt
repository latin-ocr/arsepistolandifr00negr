PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY. 581

When Ι arose and saw the dawn, Murmured like a noontide bee,
Ι sighed for thee ; Shall I nest-le near thy side?
When night rode high, and the dew was lVouldst thou me ?-—and I replied,
gone, “ No, not thee! ’'
And noon lay heavy on flower and tree, ’ .
And the weary Day turned to her rest, Death w1ll come when thou art dead,
Lingering like an unloved guest, ⁸ Soon, too soon—
1 Sighed for thee, Sleep w1ll come when thou art fied ;
Of neither would I ask the boon
Thy brother Death omne, and (nied, I ask of thee, beloved Night—
Wouldst thou me? , Swift- be thine approaehing flight,
Thy sweet child Sleep, the filmy-eyed, Come soon, soon !

 

TO A SKYLARK.

AIL to thee, blithe spirit 1— Like a high-born maiden
Η Bird thou never wert‚— In a palace tower,
That from heaven, or near it, Soothjng her loveqaden

Pourest thy full heart
In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.

Soul in secret hour
With musio sweet as love, which overflows

Higher still and hig-her, her bower ;
From the earth thou springest,

Like a cloud 0f fire3 Like a glow-worm golden
The blue deep thou wingest, In a dell of dew,

And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever Seattering unbeholden
singest· Its aerial hue

In the golden fighting Among the flowers and grass which sereen it

Of the sunken sun, from the VieW 3

O’er which clouds are brightening‚
Thou dost float and run 3
Like an embodied joy whose race is just begun.

Like a rose embowered
In its own green leaves,
By warm winds deflowered,
Till the seent it gives
Makes faint with too much sweet these heavy-

The pale, purple even
Melts around thy flight;
Like a star of heaven,

In the broa d daylight wlnged thieves.
Thou art unseen, but yet I hear thy shrill Sound Of vemal showers
dehght' On the twinkling grass,
What thou art we know not τ Ηιιὶυ-ῑικνὶὼθῌεά flou-ers,
What is most like thee? All that ever was
From ralDbOW CIOUdS there flOW ”Gt Joyous and fresh and clear thy musio doth

Drops so bright to see,

‚ surpass.
As from thy presence showers a ram of melody.
³ Like a poet hidden Teaeh us, sprite or bird,
In the light Of thought, What sweet thoughts are thine;
Singing hymns unbidden, Ῑ haVe neVffl' heard
Till the world is wrought [not 3 Praise of love or wine

To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded That panted forth a flood of rapturo so divine.
