550 THOMAS HOOD. ⁴

One day as she was sitting down “ Oh ! ΜῖὶΓΥ» VieW my wasled back,
Beside the portcr-pump— And see my dwindled calf 3

He came and knelt with all his fat Though I have never had a wife,
And made an offer plump. I've lost my better half.'’

Said she, “ My taste will never leam Alas ! in vain he still assailed,
To like so huge a man, Her beart withstood the dint ;

So Ι must beg you will come here Though he carried sixteen stone,
As little as you cau.’' He could not move a flint.

But still he stoutly urged his suit, Worn out at last he made a vow
With vows‚ and siglis, und tcars, To break his being's link;

Yet could not pierce her heart, although For he was so reduced in size
He drove thc Dart sor years. At nothing he could shrink.

In vain he wooed, in vain ho sued ; Now some will talk in water’s praise,
The maid was cool and proud, And waste a deal of breath,

And sent him off to Coventry, But John,though he drank nothing else-
While on his way to Stroud. He drank himself to death.

He fretted all the way to Stroud, The cruel maid that caused his love
And thence all back to town, Found out the fatal close,

The course of love was never smooth For looking in the butt, she saw,
So his went up and down. The butt-end of his woeS.

At last her coolness made him pine Some say his spirit haunts the Crown,
To merely bones and skin ; But that is only talk—

But still hc loved like one resolved For after riding all his life,
To love through thick and thiu. His ghost objects to walk.

 

THE: BRIDGE OF SIGHS.

The namo of this poem was suggested to the author by the “ Bridge of Sighs,'' at Venice.
This bridge received its namo from the fact that it connects the dueal palace with the prison,
and criminals pass over it to the dismal dungeons where they receive their punishment.

NE moro unfortunate Touch her not seornfullyl

lVeary of breath, Think of her mournfully,
Rashly importuuate, Gently and humanly—
Gonc to her death 1 Not of the stains of her ι
T ako her up tenderly‚ All that remains of her
Lift her with care; N ΟΨ ig Pure womanly·
Fashioned so sleuderly— Make no deep scrutiny,
Young, and so fair! Into her mutiny,

Look at her garments, Palsztaffl Z¹ilglgglgl³tiful 3

Clinging like cerements, Death has left OD her
Whilst the wave constantly Only the beautiful·

Drips from her clothiug:
Tuke her up instantly, still, for all slips of hers-
Loving, not loalhing! One of Eve’s family—
