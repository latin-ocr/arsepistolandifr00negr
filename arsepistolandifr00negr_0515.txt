ALFRED TENNYSON.

Love took up the harp of life, and smote on
all the chords with might ;

Smote the chord of self‚ that, trembling, passed
in music outof sight.

Many a morning on the moorland did we hear
the co pses ring,

And her whisper thronged my pulses with the
fulness of the spring.

Many an evening by the waters did we watch
the stately ships,

And our spirits rushed together at the toucbing
of the lips.

O my cousin, shallow—hearted! Ο my Amy,
mine no more!
Ο the dreary, dreary moorland ! O the barren,

barren shore 1

Falser than all fancy fathoms, falser than all
songs have sung—

Puppet to a father’s threat, and servile to a
shrewish tongue l

Is it well to wish thee happy ?—having known
me; to decline

On a range of lower feelings and a narrower
heart than mine !

Yet it shall be: thou shalt lower to his level

' day by day,

What is fine within thee growing coarse to
sympathize with clay.

As the husband is, the wife is3 thou art mated
with a clown,

And the grossness of his nature will have
weight to drag thee down.

He will hold thee, when his passion shall have
spent its novel force,

Something better than his dog, a little dearer
than his horse.

What is this? his eyes are heavy—think not l
they are glazed with wine,

Go to him ; it is thy duty—kiss him ; take his
hand in thine.

It may be my lord is weary, that his brain is
overwrought—

 

Soothe him with thy finer fancies, touch him ÷

with thy lighter thought.

He will answer to the purpose, easy thing to
understand—

Better thou wert dead before me, though 1
slew thee with my hand.

Better thou and I were lying, hidden from the
heart’s disgrace,

Rolled in another's arms, and silent in a last
embrace.

Cursed be the social wants that sin against
the strength of youth!

Cursed be the social lies that warp us from the
living truth 1

Cursed be the sickly forms that e'er from hon—
est nature’s rule!

Cursed be the gold that gilds the straitened
forehead of the fool!

Well—’tis well that Ι should bluster t—Hadst
thou less unworthy proved,

Would to God——for Ι had loved thee more
than ever wife was loved.

Am Ι mad, that I should cherish that which
bears but bitter fruit?

I will pluck it from my bosom, though my
heart he at the root.

Never! though my mortal summers to such
length of years should come

As the many-wintcred crow that leads the
clanging rookery home.

there is comfort? in division of the records
of the mind?

Can I part her from herself, and love her, as I
knew her, kind?

Ι reniember ono that perished: sweetly did
she speak and in‹›v(=;

Such a one do Ι rcmeniber, whom to look at
was to love.

Can Ι think of lwr as (lead, and love her for
the love she hore?

No—shc never lovcd me truly; love is love
for evermore.

Comfort? comfort scorned of devils! this is
truth the poet sings,

That a sorrow’s crown of sorrow is rvmember’
ing happier things.
