together before that cherub in white cambric ¹
on the sofa there. You enter into conversa-
tion with it as you speak to any body else,
and Ι assai] it with those honeyed elisions‚'
and tenderest nonsenses, shorn of labials and
denuded of harsh consonants, made fluent
and gracious with the indescribable loving
sounds that Sir Thomas Browne meant when
he asked leave ιο “ coin the word cordiloquy.''
Don’t you see whom those dreamy eyes turn
toward and seek for? Is it you those blessed
little arms reach for? Is it you the soft pink
lips begin to answer with inarticulate tones

ROSE TERRY COOKE.

 

and the pucker of a coming smile? Ah nol
you know better! I have conquered you
with the most irresistible logie—with the
baby’s own induction from fairly-stated
premisae: bless its heart!

So it naturally came about that Hannah
had more to do with the baby than Mrs.
Anthon herself ; and as she possessed fully
the true feminine joy in being tyrannized
over, and knew the art of spoiling children

 

“1¹1¹ IS MORE BLESSED.”

1VE1 as the morning that flows out of
heaven;
Givel as the waves when their chan-
nel is riven;
Give 1 as the free air and sunshine are given ;
Lavishly‚ utterly, joyfully give :—
Not the waste drops of thy cup overflowing‚
Not the faint sparks of thy hearth ever
glowing,
Not a pale bud from the June roses blowing3
Give, as He gave thee, who gave thee to
live.

Pour out thy love, like the rush of a river,

Wasting its waters, forever and ever,

Through the burnt sands that reward not the
iver;

Silgnt or songful‚ thou nearest the sea.
Scatter thy life, as the summer showers pouring!
What if no bird through the pearl-rain is

soaring?
What if no blossom looks upward adoring?

Look to the life that was lavished for thee 1

   
  
   
   
    
   
     
   
   
   
   
      
    

by heart, Master Peter, by his third year, had
Hannah completely under his thumb‚ and re·
garded his mother with the same calm admir-
ration he felt for the sideboard. Peter was
beginning to be troublesome, to tell the truth-

Mrs. Anthon had set hours for his recep-
tion; but he would secrete scraps of bread
and butter under his embroidered frock, and
produce them on Mamma's satin lap, or daub
his fingers on the camel's hair shawl, or play
horse with a big velvet chair‚ and bang it up
against the sideboard, till glass and plato
trembled at the shock, while his lawful gow-
erness sat quaking on the sofa, all unable to4
redress her grievances short of using physical¹
force, of which she disapproved3 and utter-
ing inadequate remonstrances and remarks,
unheard in the noise of Peter’s cavalry charge,
and fully convinced that some one had blun-
dered in supposing character to be hereditary;
for did not that uproarious, astonishing, inex-
plicable child spring from the highest old
respectability ?

So the wild wind strews its perfumed caresses,

Evil and thankless the desert it blesses,

Bitter the wave that its soft pinion presses,
Never it ceaseth to whisper and sing.

What if the hard heart gives thorns for thy

roses ‘r‘

What if 011 rocks thy tired bosom reposes?

Sweetest is music with minor-keyed closes‚
Fairest the vines that on ruin will cling.

Almost the day of thy giving is over;

Ere from the grass dies the bec-haunted

Thou willeh‘alve vanished from friend and from
XVffzirtegliall thy longing avail in the grave?

Give, as the beart gives, whose fetters aro Α

Life, lolvleffatiiictlohope, all thy dreams and thys'

Soon ῂέἵιῗξιηῑξῖῐίνοι· thy soul-fever slaking,
Thou shalt know God, and the gift “ ‚

he gave.
