WILLIAM CoWPER.
Noted for Hymns and PoemS.

 

⁷ ζ’. OWPER was born in Hertfordshire in 1731. His father was one
⁵ ἶ N of the chaplains to George ΙΙ. and nephew to Lord Chancellor
Cowper. His health was frail, and when, after being admitted to
the bar, he was appointed reading clerk in the House of Lords‚
his timidity was so great that he refused to appear. He soon
became actually insane, and was removed to an asylum, and
during the rest of his life was subject to returns of mental alienation.
His attention being turned to poetry he contributed sixty-eight hymns
to a collection made by Rev. John Newton, called the “ Olney Hymns.''
The ballad of “John Gilpin '' gave him a wide renown. It was read
to crowded audiences in London by Henderson, the actor. “The Task‚''
1785, his longest original poem, gained general popularity. He next
translated Homer into blank verse. His last poem, “The Castaway‚’' is
a picture of his own sad fate. He died April 25, 1800. In his poetry he
was one of the first to break away from the metrical despotism of Pope,
being persuaded to do so by his friend and neighbor‚ Lady Austin, at
whose instigation he wrote some of his best poemS.
One of Cowper‘s famous productions is the poem written when he
received his mother's portrait. He had fits of melancholy and was sev-
eral times over the line of insanity.

ose ips are thme,—thy own sweet smlle Ι same·
The gaffi'that 0st in childhood solaced me; Faithful remembrancer of one so dear!

Voice only fails, else how distinct they say, Ο WsslCOme guest> though unexpeooed here Ῑ,
⁸‘ Grieve not, my 0hild; chase all thy fem-g Who bid’st me honor with an artless song,
away ! ” Affectioffate, a mother lost so long.
