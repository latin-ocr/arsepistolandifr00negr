BERT BROWNING, by some regarded the greatest of modern Ξ
Ν English poets, was bornat Camberwell, a suburb of London, .
May 7, 1812. He traveled extensively in Italy, and made an
exhaustive study of its history and people. His first poem of
note, ί(Ρ3130015115,” 1835, revealed his energy, boldness of
thought and grasp of human passion. “Men and Women,’'
containing some of his finest work, appeared in 1855, and his master-
piece, ‘¹' The Ring and the Book,'' in 1869.

He also wrote several dramas, which were acted by Macready, Miss
Cushman and other stars, but they did not meet with great popular favor·
Browning 15 distinguished for the depth of his spiritual insight, his dra-
matic energy and power of psychological analysis. His style is fre-
quently obscure and difficult, his versification hard and rugged, and his
rhymes forced. Browning died December 12, 1889, at Venice, the very
day his last volume of poems was published, and was buried in West-
minster Abbey.

An extended correspondence with Elizabeth Barrett, the poetess, led
to love and an engagement before Browning ever met her. The two were
clandestinely married in 1846 and made their home in Florence.

 

 

INOIDENTS OF THE FRENGH GAMP.

OU know we French stormed Ratisbon: Let once my army-leader Lannes
A mile or so away, Waver at yonder wall‚''—
On a little mound, Napoleon Out 'twixt the battery-smoke there flew
Stood on our storming-day; A rider, bound on bound
With neck out-thrust‚ you fancy how, Full-galloping ; nor bridle drew
Legs wide⁷ arms locked behind, Until he reached the mound.

As if to balance the prone brow,

Oppressive With its mind· Then off there flung in smiling joy,

And held himself erect
J nst as perhaps he mused, “ My plans By just his horse’s mane, a boy:

4That soar, to earth may fall, You hardly could suspect,
