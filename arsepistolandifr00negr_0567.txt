THOMAS MOORE. 519

When, around thee dying, Then should music, stealing

Autumn leaves are lying, All the soul of feeling,

O then remember me! TO thy beart appealing,
Draw one tear from thee—-

⁶ Then let memory bring thee
ΟΠ the gay hearth blazmg, Strains Ι used to sing thee;
O, still remember me! Ο then remember me!

And, at night, when gazing

THE LIGH'I' OF OTHER DAYS.
FT in the stilly night, XVhen Ι remember all

Ere Slumber’s chain has bound me, The friends, so linked together,
Fond Memory brings the light I’ve seen around me fall,
Of other days around me ; · Like leaves in wintry weather,
The smiles, the tears, Ι feel like one
Of boyhood's years, tho treads alone
The words of love then spoken 3 Some banquet hall deserted,
The eyes that shone, VVhose lights are fied,
Now dimmed and gone, Whose garlands dead,
The eheerful hearts now broken ! And all but he departed!
Thus in the stilly night, Thus in the stilly night,
Ere Slumber’s chain has bound me, , Ε16 Slumber's chain has bound me,
Sad Memory brings the light. Sad Memory brings the light
Of other days around me. Of others days around me.

PALESTINE.
OW, upon Syria's land of 10565 ¹ To one who looked from dofle-fair

Softly the light of eve 16110565, 1 O’er all the enehanted regions there,

And, like a glory, the broad sun 1 How beauteous must have been the glow,
Hangs over sainted Lebanon, 1 T 116 life, how sparkling from below!
WVhose head in wintry grandem· towers, F air gardens, shining streams, with ranks

And whitens with eternal sleet‚ Of golden melons on their banks

While summer. in a vale of flowers‚ More golden where the sunlight falls;

Is sleeping rosy at his feet. Gay lizards, glittering on the walls
