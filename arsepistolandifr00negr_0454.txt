These words, spoken with long intervals
and ever-increasing weakness, were very near
the last. Just before (131111 he eried with a
strange glad strength, “1 am going now—
1 11316 long been eager for rest.’' A solemn
pallor spread 0161 1115 face, a dying breath
fluttered through the room, and Ian was gone

-gone away farther than human thought
could follow him. A sudden feeling of alit-na-
tion‚ 3 561156 of incalcuable distance was now

“1 am like the pilgrim, ‘I feel the l sensitive to it; but he waited until the great

    
 

between them, and Maekenzie was koenly

The sun was then shining brightly, the
ocean breaking solemnly almost at the thren-2
hold: there were 501116 fis hermen just putting'
'out to 563 and there was a faint sound of
rowers striking the 33 aves 111 harmony3 but

that 33 as not of this world. W alking thought-
fully through the village, he met Shaw McDuff
driving in 3 very splendid carriage with 3
11311(1501116, middle-aged woman.

Then he remembered that Peter had been
boasting round the countryside that “his son
Shaw was going to marry 3 widow lady
whose money could not be counted by the
ordinary tables of addition 3 moreover, 3 lady
of the noble family of Farquarson.'’

And though Maekenzie’s beart was beating
to the most tender and solemn thoughts, he ,
looked at the lady and at the haughty young
man reclining at her side, and knew that, for
once, Peter's boasting had truth in it. ,And
this strange meeting of death and life moved
him very much, and he was thinking of it
aud of two lines of Milton’s, which Macrae
had once quoted to him on some such occasion:

“ What if earth be but the shadow of heaven
and things therein,
