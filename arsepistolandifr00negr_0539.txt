ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.

You have written my lesson of duty out,
Man-like you have questioned me—
Now stand at the bar of my woman's soul,

Until Ι shall question thee.

You require your mutton shall always be hot,
Your socks and your shirts shall be whole 3

I require your heart to be true as God's stars,
And pure as heaven your soul.

You require a cook for your mutton and beef ;
I require a far better thing ; [shuts——

A seamstress you're wanting for stoekings and
I look for a man and a king 1-

Α king for a beautiful 10111111 called home,
And a man that the Maker, God,
Shall look upon as he did the first,
And say, “ It is very good.''

 

491

Ι 11111 fair and young, but the rose will fade
From my 0011, young cheek one day—
Will you love then, 'mid the falling leaws³

As you did ’mid the bloom of May?

Is your heart an ocean so strong and deep
I may 101111011 my all on its tide?

A loving woman finds heaven or hell
On the day she is made a bride.

I require all things that are grand and true,
All things that a man should be;

If you give this all, I would stake my life
To be all you demand of me.

If you cannot do this—a laundress and oook
You ean hire with little to pay ;

But a woman's heart and a woman’s life
Are not 10 be Won that way.

HOW DO I LOVE THEE?
FRoM THE PORTUGUESE.

OW do Ι love thee? Let me count the Ι love thee purely, as they turn from praise.

Ι 1ζ3ἔ1100 10 the depth, and breadth‚
and height

Ι love thee with the passion put to 1100
Ι11 ngiffld griefs, and with my ehildhood's

My soul ean reach, when feeling, out of I love thee with a love I seemed to lose

sight,
For the ends of being and ideal grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
Ι love thee freely as men strive for right;

With my lost saints. Ι love thee with the

SmileS'bss'gZssslsss of all my life I—and‚ if God

I shalllffiiste’love thee better after death.

THE GHILD AND THE WATOHER.

LEEP on, baby on the floor,
Tired of all thy playing—

Sleep with smile the sweeter for
That you dropped away in ;

On your curls' fair roundness stand
Golden lights serenely ;

One oheek‚ pushed out by the hand,
F olds the dimple inly—

Little head and little foot
Heavy laid for pleasure;

Underneath the lids half-shut
Plants the shining azure;

Open-souled in noonday sun,
So, you lie and slumber;

Nothing evil having done,
Nothing can encumber.

I, who cannot sleep as well,
Shall I sigh to view you?
Or sigh further to foretell
All that may undo you?
Nay, keep smiling, little child,
Ere the fate appeareth !

Ι smile, too 3 for patience mild
Pleasure's token weareth.
Nay, keep sleepin g before 1000;

Ι shall sleep, though lesing!
As by Gracile, so by oross,
Sweet is the repes-ing.
