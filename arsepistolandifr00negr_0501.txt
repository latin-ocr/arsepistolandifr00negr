Being without passion, 'twill soon be the fashion These do without fear, and to all you'll appear

TO grace your smooth looks With a twine Fair, Charlning, true, IOVely and elever;
string Though the times reinain darkish, young men
may be sparkish,
Throw aside your Bobea, and your Green Hy· And love >¹0¹¹ fflUCh Stronger than ever·
SOU tea, Then make yourselves easy, for no one will
And all things with a new-fashion duty: teazss ye,
Procure a good store of the 6110166 Labi-ador, Nor tax you, if chaneing to sneer [fools;
For there’ll soon be enough here suit to At 1116 sense-ridden tools‚ who think us all
you. But they'll find the reverse far and near.

LOVE‘S SEASONS.
BY AMELIA RIVEs CHANDLER.

Born in Richmond, Virginia, August 23, 1863. At an early age became a contributor
to magazines; wrote “The Quick and the Dead,” and other works that exhihit unusual
intellectual strength, passion and disregard of conventional whiins and fancies.

HE wall-flowers to the frolic wind The birds are winging for the south,

Do Dance their golden aigelets‚ The elf-inaids haste them to their bowers,
And elf-maids steal the hawthorn beads And dandeli‹›n hails do fioat

To wear for fairy amulets. Like silver ghosts of golden ssowors.
The spring is here, the spring is here— The autumn’s 11616, 1116 31111111111’6 here—-
The love-time of the year, my dear! The wife-time of the year, my dear!
All heavy hang the apple boughs‚ Now are the heavens not more gray

Weighed down by balls of yellow gold ; Thau are the eyes of her Ι love;
The poppy oupS, so fiery bright, More dainty white than her sweet breast

Me seems would burn the hearts they hold, The snow lies not the earth above.
The suminer's here, the sunnner's 11616- The winter's here, the winter's here—-
The kiss-time of the year, my dear! But love-time lasts the year, my dear!

GOLLINET AND PHEBE.

This song of 1776 was long popular among the 6010111616. It was first printed in 1116
Pennsylvania Magazine, and ocoasionally reprintcd in the newspapms, as 1116 war progr-essed.

S Collinet and Phebe sat ‘⁴ Then Phebe now, approve my vow,
Beneath a poplar grove, By truth, by fondness pressed ;
The gentle youth, with fondest truth, A 6111116 assume to grace thy hloom,
Was telling tales of love. And make the shepherd blest.''
“ Dear blooming maid,'' the shepherd said, A blush o’erspread her oheek with red,
‘⁸ My tender vows believe, Which half she turned asido ;
These downeast eyes, and artless sighs‚ With pleasing woes her bosom rose,
Can ne’er thy saith deceive. And thus the maid replied—
‘⁴ Though some there are. from fair to fair, “ Dear gentle youth, Ι know thy truth,
Delighting wild to rove, And all thy arts to please ;
Such change thou ne’ex from me canst fear; But ah ! is this a time for bliss‚

Thy charms secure my love. Or themes as sost as these?
