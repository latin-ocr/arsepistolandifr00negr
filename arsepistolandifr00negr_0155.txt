MARK TWAIN.

“Ah—what—what did you say was the
name of the party who wrote this?'’
“Christopher Colombo! ze great Christo-

pher Colomb0!”

Another deliberate examination.

“ Ah—did he write it himself, or-or how?''

“He write it himselfl—Christopher Co-
lomb0! he’s own handwriting, write by him-
self! '’

Then the doctor laid the document down,
and said,

“ Why, Ι have seen boys in America only
fourteen years old that could write better than
that.''

“ But zis is ze great Christo-”

“I don't care who it is! It’s the worst
writing Ι ever saw. Now you mustn’t think
you can impose on us because we are stran-
gers. We are not fools‚ by a good deal. If
you have got any speci mens of penmanship of
real merit, trot them out l—and if you haven’t‚
drive on Ψ

We drove on. The guide was considerably
shaken up, but he made one more venture.
He had something which he thought would
overcome us. He said,

‘⁴ Ah, genteelmen, you come wis me! Ι show
you beautiful, oh, magnificent bust Christopher
Colombo—splendid, grand, magnificent! ”

He brought us before the beautiful bust—
for it was beautiful—and sprang back and
struck an attitude:

“ Ah, look, genteelmenl—beautifuL grand
——bust Christopher Colombo I—beautiful bust,
beautiful pedestal !''

The doctor put up his eye-glass——procured
for such occasions :

‘⁴ Ah—what did you say this gentleman’s
name was? ’'

“Christopher Colombol ze great Christo-
pher Colombo l ’'

“ Christopher Colombo—the great Christo-
pher Colombo. Well, what did ke do? ”

“ Discover America l—discover America,
oh, ze devil l '’

’ “ Discover America? No—that statement
, will hardly wash. We are just fro‘m America
ourselves. We heard nothing about it. Chris-
topher Colombo—pleasant name—is-is he
dead ἱ) ”

“Oh, corpo di Baccho l—three hundred

year!''

“What did he die of? ”

“I do not know. I cannot tell.’'

“ Small-pox‚ think?'’

“I do not know, genteelmen—I do not
know what he died of.''

“ Measles, likely ‘3 ’'

“ Maybe—maybe. I do not know—I think
he die of something.’'

“ Parents living ἱ) ”

“ Im-possible Ι ”

“Ah—which is the bust and which is the
pedestal? '’

“Santa Maria I—zis ze bustl-—zis ze ped-
estal ! ”

“Ah, I see, Ι see—happy combination—
very happy combination indeed. Is—is this
the first time this gentleman was ever on a
bust?'’

That joke was lost on the foreigner; guides
cannot master the subtleties of the American
joke.

We have made it interesting for this Roman
guide. Yesterday we spent three or four
hours in the Vatican again, that wonderful
world of curiosities. We came very near
expressing interest sometimes, even admira-
tion. It was hard to keep from it. We suc-
ceeded, though. Nobody else ever did, in
the Vatican museums. The guide was be-
wildered‚ nonplussed. He walked his legs
off, nearly, hunting up extraordinary things,
and exhausted all his ingenuity, on us, but it
was a failure; we never showed any interest
in anything. He had reserved what he con-
sidered to be his greatest wonder till the last
——a royal Egyptian mummy, the best pre-

served in the world, perhaps. He took us
there. He felt so sure, this time, that some

of his old enthusiasm came back to him :

“See‚ genteelmen l—Mummy 1 Mummy 1 '’

The eye-glass came up as calmly, as delib-
erately as ever.

“Ah—what did Ι understand you to say
the gentleman’s name was? ’²

“ Name ?—he got no name l-—Mummy 1-
’Gyptian mummy !''

“ Yes, yes. Born here? ”

“ No. 'Gyptian mummy.''
