ALFRED AUSTIN. 599

Should envious aliens plan and plot Now let us give one hearty grip,
’Gainst one, and now the other, As by true men is given,

They swist would learn how strong the knot And vow fraternal fellowship
Binds brother unto brother. That never shall be riven ;

How quickly they would change their tack And with our peaceful flags unfurled,
And show the recreant feather, Be fair or foul the weather‚

should Star and Stripe and Union J ack, should need atrise, face all the world,
But float mast-high together. And stand or fau together.

 

THE LAST REDOUBT.

AOELYVO’S slope still felt -3 Brandishing blade with a gallant air,
The cannons’ bolts and the rifles' pelt ; His head erect aud his bosom bare.
Forthe last redoubt up the hill remained, ι’ “ Fly! they are on us! '' his men implored‚
By the Russ yet held, by the Turk not gained. ἰ But he waved them ou with his waving sword.
Mehemet Ali stroked his beard 3 ‘⁴ It cannot be held; 'tis no shame to go! '’
His lips were clinched and his look was weird ; , But he stood with his face set hard to the foe.
Round him were ranks of his ragged folk, ξ
Their faces blackened with blood and smoke. ὖ “ Yield! '' but 810st his steel he fiaShed›
And down on their steel it ringing clashed,
Then back he reeled with a bladeless hilt,
ἦ His honor full, but his life blood spilt.
ί They lifted him up from the dabbled ground;

And on to the last redoubt thev poured. ι {ps limbs wer? shapely apd ³⁰st andffround'
· o down on hls hp, on hls cheek no shade—

⁰¹¹⁶ fen’andaseoefld quickly Smpped '“Bismillahl'’ the med· “'tis an infidei
The gap that he left when he reeled and maid!„ y '

The secdohelllllzdthird straight filled his place; l Mehemet Ali came and saw

The third—and a fourth kept up the race. The riddled breast and the tender jaw.

‘⁶ Clear me the Muscovite out! ’' he crie‹l‚

Then the name of “ Allah ! ” echoed wide,

And thle fezze?l were waved and the bayonets
owere ,

Many a fez in the mud was crushed, ι’ Make hPr .³‘ bier Of ‚VPUI‘ arms,’' he Said,
Many a throat that cheered was hushed‚ “ And damtfly bury thls dalflty dead Ῑ

Many a heart that sought the erest, Mal-xe her a ’grave where she stood and fell,
Found Allah's arms and an houri’s breast. 'Gafflst the Jasskal’S Sssrfltch and the vulture's
Over their corpses the living sprang‚ ι 8111911, · ι · .

And the ridge with their musket-rattle rang, 1 D1d the Muscovlte men like thelr maidens-sight,
Tin the faces that fined the last redoubt i In their lines we had scarcely supped to-night.'’

could see their faces and hear their shout. l

In the redoubt a fair form towered,
That cheereg up the brave and chid the
cowar ;

So a deeper trench 'mong the trenches there
Was dug for the form as brave as fair ;
And none, till the judgment trump and shout‚

Shall drive her out of the Last Redoubt.

 

 

‚1s LIFE WORTH Lrvme.

S life worth living? Yes, so long
As spring revives the year,
And hails us with the cuckoo’s song,
To show that she is here ;
So long as May of April takes
In smiles and tears farewell,

And windflowers dapple all the brakes,
And primroses the dell ;

And children in the woodlands yet
Adorn their little laps

With ladysmock and violet,
And daisy-chain their caps;
