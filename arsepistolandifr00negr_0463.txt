Such honore grace the bed,
I know, whereon the warrior lays his head,
And hears, as life ebbs out,
The conquered flying, and the conqueror’s
shout;
But as his eye grows dim,
What is a column or a mound to him?

What, to the parting soul‚
The mellow note of bugles‘? What the roll

Of drums? No, let me die
Where the blue heaven bends o’er me lov-

ingly‚

‘JOHN PIERPONTK

And the soft summer air,

As it goes by me, stirs my thin white hair,
And from my forehead dries

The death-(lamp as it gathers, and the skins
Seem waiting to receive

My soul to their clear depthsl Or let me 'leave
The world when round my bed

Wife‚ children, weeping friends are gathered,
And the calm voice of prayer

And holy hymning shall my soul prepare
To go and be at rest

With kindred spirits‚—spirits who have blessed
The human brotherhood

By labors, cares, and counsels for their good

 

PLYMOUTH DEDIGATION HYMN.

HE winds and waves were roaring3
The Pilgrims met for prayer;
And here, their God adoring,
They stood, in open air.
When breaking day they greeted,
And when its close was calm,
The leafless woods repeated
The music of their psalm.

Not thus, O God, to praise thee,
Do we, their children, throng:
The temple's arch we raise thee
Gives back our choral song.
Yet, on the winds that bore thee
Their worship and their prayers,
May ours come up before thee
From hearts as true as theirs!

that have we, Lord, to bind us
To this, the Pilgrim's shore 1—

Their hill of graves behind us,
Their watery way before,

The wintry surge, that dashes
Against the rocks they trod,

Their memory and their ashes,-
Be thou their guard, O God,

We would not, Holy Father‚
Forsake this hallowed spot,

Till on that shore we gather
VVhere graves and griefs are not;

The shore where true devotion
Shall rear no pillured shrine,

And see no other ocean

Than that of love divine.

FOR THE FOURTH OF JULY.

AY of glory! welcome day!
Freedom's banners greet thy ray ;
See! how cheerfully they play
With thy morning breeze,
On the rocks where pilgrims kneeled,
On the heights where squadrons wheeled,
When a tyrant’s thunder pealed
O'er the trembling seas.

God of armies ! did thy “ stars

In their courses ” smite his cars,

Blast his arm, and wrest his bars
From the heaving tide!

On our standard, lo! they burn,

And, when days like this return,

Sparkle o'er the soldiers‘ urn
Who for freedom died.

God of peace l—whose spirit fills

All the echoes of our hills,

All the mur-murs ‹⁷2f our rills,
Now the storm is o'er 3—

Ο, let freemen be 0111· 50115;

And. let future XVashingtons

Rise, to lead their valiant oneS,
Till there's war 110 more.
