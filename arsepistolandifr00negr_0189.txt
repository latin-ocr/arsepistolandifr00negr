February 9, 1822, he was brought to this country when five

ὃ years old, and may be said to have grown up to be a typical
,ἒ American with a literary turn of mind. After a brief educa-
tion and career as a teacher, he became a contributor to various

periodicals, including the “ Home Journal,‘’ but his well—earned
131116 rests upon the biographies he wrote, which are among the very best
ever published in the United States.

His first published work was the “Life of Horace Greeley‚'' issued
in 1855 and enlarged in 1869. 11 was successful froin the first. After
editing the “ Η11111010115 Poetry of the English Languagc,'' he brought
out, in 1859, his “Life aud Times of Aaron Burr‚'' which presented
Burr's character in a less repulsive aspect than that 111 which it had been
commonly regarded.

In 1860 he issued a “ Life of Andrew Jackson'' 111 four volumes,
His patient research, his impartial spirit, his appreciation of the grand
points in Jackson‘s character, and his terse, vigorous style combined to
make this a remarkable biography, the best ever written upon “Old
Hickory.’' During the Civil WVar Mr. Parton took an active interest in
passing events, He was an avowed admirer of Benj amin F. Butler, and
in 1863 he published, “General Butler in New Orleans.'' This was a
history of General Butler's administration of the Department of the Gulf

Times,‘' containing lives of Clay, Webster‚ Calhonn, Randolph, Girard,
