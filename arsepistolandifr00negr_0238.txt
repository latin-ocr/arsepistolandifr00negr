190 MARIETTA HOLLEY.

for which she received ffiropoo before it was issued by a Philadelphia
publisher. It is said that nearly one quarter of a million copies of this
book have been sold. Miss Holley has also been a contributor to the
“Ladies' Home Journal,'' and in 1894 issued another humorous work
entitled, “Samantha at the World's Fair.‘’ Miss Holley’s humor is of
the wholesome type, imbued with common sense and she never provokes
laughter at anything which is good. Rather, in the most playful and

laughter provoking manner, does she hit off the follies and foibles of ¹

society. She can see something humorous in almost every person, every
snatch of conversation and every style of dress.

JOSIAH ALLEN’S WIF'E OALLS ΟΝ THE PRESIDENT.

FROM “SWEET CICELY:²·' PERMISSION OF FUNK & WAGNALLS.

ND so we wended our way down the
broad, beautiful streets towards the
White House.

Handsomer streets I never see. Ι had
thought Jonesville streets wus middlin’ hand-
some and roomy. Why, two double wagons
can go by each other in perfect safety, right
in front of the grocery stores, where there is
lots of boxes too; and wimmen can be
a-walkin' there too at the same time, hefty
01166.

Β111, good land! loads of hay could pass
each other here, and droves of dromedaries,
and ca1nels‚ and not touch each other, and
111611 111616 would be lots of room for men and
wimmen, and for wagons to rumble, and peri-
oguers to float up and down—if perioguers
could sail on dry land.

Roomier, handsomer, well-shadeder streets
Ι never want to see, nor don’t expect to.
Why J onesville streets are like tape compared
with 'e1n; and Loontown and Toad HoHer,
they are like thread, No. 50 (allegory).

Bub Smith was well acquainted with the
President’s hired man, so he let us in without
parlay.

Ι don’t believe in talkin' big as a general
thing. But think'es Ι, Η61·6 Ι be, a-holdin'
up the dignity of Jonesville: aud here I be,
011 a deep, beart-searchin' errent to the
Nation. 80 Ι said, in words and axents a

ἀΐω] of the Abbey'' and “Charlotte Tem-
eo),—
p “ Is the President of the United States
within ? ’²

He said he was, but said sunthin’ about his
not receiving calls in the mornings.

But I says in a very polite way‚—for I like ⁴
to put folks at their ease, presidents or ped- ..

(11616 01 anything.—

“It hain't no matter at all if he hain’t
dressed up; of course he wasn't expectin’ '
company. J osiah don't dress up mornin's. ⁵

And then he says something about “ he
didn't know but he was engaged.''

Says I, “That hain't no news to me, nor ·

the Nation. We have been a-hearin' that for
three years, right along. And if he is
engaged, it ain’t no good reason why he
shouldn't speak to other wimmen‚·- good,
honorable married ones too.''

“Well‚'’ says he, finally, “I will take up
your card.” ‘

“No, you won’t ! ’' says I firmly, “ I am a
Methodist! I guess I can start off on a short
tower without takin' a pack of cards with me.
And if I had 'em right here in my pocket, or
a set of dominoes‚ Ι shouldn’t expect to take
up the time of the President of the United
States a-playin' games at this time of the
day.'' Says Ι, 111 deep tones, “ I am a-carrien’
errents to the President that the world known

good deal like them Ι have read of in “ 01111- not of.'
