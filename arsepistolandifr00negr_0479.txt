OUNG men. you are the architects of
your own fortunes. Rely upon your
own strength of body and soul. Take

sor your star sels-relianee, saith, honesty, and
iudustry. Inscribe on your banner, ‘⁸' Luck is
a fool, pluck is a hero.’' Don’t take too much
advice—keep at your helm and steer your

Think well of yourself. Strike out. Assume

reliant. Be genet-ons. Be civil. Read the
papers. Advertise your business. Make
money and do good with it. Love your God

ΝΟ SEG'I'S IN HEAVEN.
ΒΥ 111113. CLEVELAND.

ALKING of 36613 1111 late 0116 eve,
Of the various doctrines the saints believe,
That night I stood, in a troubled dream,

By the side of a darkly flowing stream.

And a “Churchman '' down to the river ca1ne; 1

When I heard a strange voice call his name,
“Good father, stop; when you cross this tide,
You must leave your robes on the other si‹le.''

But the aged father did not mind ;
And his long gown floated out behind,

 

As down to the stream his way he took,
His pale hands clasping a gilt-edged book.

“ I’1n bound for heaven; and when I’m there,
Shall want my Book of Common Prayer;
And, though 1 put on 11 starry crown,

1 should feel quite lost without my gown.”

Then he fixed his eyes on the shining track,
But his gown was heavy and held him back,
And the poor old father tried in vain,

1 Α single step in the flood to gain.
