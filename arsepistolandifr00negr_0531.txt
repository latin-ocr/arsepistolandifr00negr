And so the Church Establishment, regarded
in its theory and ⁴in its aim, is beautiful and
attractive. Yet what is it but an appropi-la-
tion of public property, an appropriation of
the fruits of labor and of skill to certain pnr-
poses, and unless these purposes are fulfilled,
that appropriation cannot be justified. There-
fore, sir, I cannot but feel that we must set
aside fears which th rust themselves upon the
imagination and act upon the sober dictates
of our judgment.
