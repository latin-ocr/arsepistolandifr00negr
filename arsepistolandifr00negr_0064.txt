It was evident that Toby had listened to

and these phrases he connected by various
expletives, and sounds of which we could
make nothing. At length he began to salter,
when the captain with admirable presence of
mind came to his relief, and interrupted and
closed the harangue with an hurrah from the
company. Toby was allowed by all the spec-

SONG OF MARION’S ΜΕΝ.

UR band is few, but true and tried,
Our leader frank and bold ;
The British soldier trembles
NVhen Marion's name is told,
Our fortress is the good greenwood,
Our tent the cypress-tree3
We know the forest round ns,
As seamen know the sea:
We know its walls of thorny vines,
Its gladcs of reedy grass,
Its safe and silent islands
Within the dark morass

lVoe to the English soldiery
That little dread us near!

On them shall light at midnight
A strange and sudden fear3

then, waking to their tents on fire,
They grasp their arms in vain,

And they who stand to face us
Are beat to earth agaim

And they who fly in terror, deem
A mighty host behind,

And hear the tramp of thousands
Upon the hollow wind.

Thon sweet the hour that brings release
From danger and from toil:

We talk the battle over,
And share the battle's spoil.

The woodlands ring with laugh and shout
As if a hunt were up,

And woodland flowers are gathered
To crown the soldier’s cup.

With merry songs we moek the wind
That in the pine-top grieves

And slumber long and sweetly
On beds of oaken leaves.

Well knows the fair and friendly moon
The band that Marion leads—

The glitter of their rifles,
The scampering of their ste-eds.

'Tis life to guide the fiery barb
Across the moonlight plain ;

’Tis life to feel the night-wind
That lifts his tossing mane.

A moment in the British camp—
A moment-and away !

Back to the pathless forest,
Before the peep of day.

Grave men there are by broad Santee,
Grave men with hoary hairs;

Their hearts are all with Marion,
For Marion are their prayers.

And lovel y ladies greet our band
With kindliest welcoming,

With smiles like those of summer,
And tears like those of spring.
For them we wear these trusty arms

And lay them down no more
'sill we have driven the Briton,
F orever, from our shore.
