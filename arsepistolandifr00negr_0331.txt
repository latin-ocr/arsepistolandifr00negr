WILLIAM DEAN Howfltts.
Novelist and Poet.

 

τῖ’ v -· ν R. HOWELLS, whose name has long been associated with the

best magazine literature and works of fiction, was born at
l χ Martin's Ferry, Ohio‚ March 1st, 1837. The broad and liberal
’ : ³ spirit he has always exhibited may be due to the fact that
while his father's family was of Quaker origin, he himself
was brought up a Swedenborgian. In early life he had much
to do with printing and press work, journalism, and such writing as
naturally finds its way into a country newspaper. He was employed on
the “Cincinnati Gazette ’³ and “Columbus State Journal.’'

The first work that brought Mr. Howells into notice was his Life of
Lincoln, which was published in 1860. Η616 116 showed a marked ability
in grasping facts, and discriminating between what is worthy and what is
worthless in the biography of a great man. Mr. Lincoln was thus
brought into contact with the young author, and being favorably impressed
with him, made him consul at Venice, a position which he held from 1861
10 1865. During this time he familiarized himself with the Italian
language and wrote a series of papers which were collected and published
on “ Venetian Life,'' 1866.

When Mr. Howells returned to America he began writing for such
newspapers as the “ New York Tribune,’' and “ New York Times,'' and
such periodicals as “The Nation,'' and the ‘⁴ Atlantic Monthly.'' The
responsible place of editor‘s chair was filled by 111111 011 1116 131161 periodi-
cal from 1872 to 1881. After this his work for periodicals was for “The
Century,'' and “ Harper's Magazine.'' He had already devoted some
attention to writing poetry and had found a ready publication for his
poems. He was also known as a critic and essayist, when in 1871 116
published his first work of fiction, entitled “ Their VVedding Journey.''
This introduction to the great public who read fiction, was encouraging,
and he continued to issue similar works. The best of these are, “ A
Chance Acquai'ntance,'' 18733 “A Foregone Conclusion,'' 1874, “A

Counterfeit Presentment,'' 1877; “The Lady of the Aroostook,''08{878;
