prevent the suspicion of our ever having met
before.

The dancing continued for more than two
hours with spirit, when the time admonished
the village maidens of the necessity of retir-
ing. Seeing an indication of the approaching
separation, Jaap held out his hat to me, in
a respectful manner, when Ι magnificently
dropped my shilling into it in a way to attract
attention, and passed it round among the males
of the party. One other gave a shilling, two
clubbed and actually produced a quarter,
several threw in sixpences, or fourpence-half-

105

pennies, and coppers made up the balance.
By way of climax, the landlady, who was
good-looking aud loved daucing, publicly
announced that the fiddler and his horse
should go scot free, until he left the place. By
these ingenious means of Jaap’sI found in my
purse next morning seven-and-sixpence in sil-
ver, in addition to my own shilling, besides
copper enough to keep a negro in cider for a
week.

I have ol'ten laughed over Jaap’s manage-
ment, though I would not permit him to
repeat it.

 

VENIOE AT NIGHT.

HE moon was at the height. Its rays fell
in a flood on the swelling domes and
massive roofs of Venice, while the margin
of the town was brilliantly defined by the
glittering bay. The natural and gorgeous
setting was more than worthy of that picture
of human magnificence; for at that moment,
rich as was the queen of the Adriatic in her
works of art, the grandeur of her public
monuments, the number and splendor of her
palaces, and most else that the ingennity and
ambition of man could attempt, she was but
secondary in the glories of the hour.
Above was the firmament gemmed with
worlds‚ and sublime in immensity. Beneath
lay the broad expanse of the Adriatic, endless

 

to the eye, tranquil as the vault it reflected,
and luminous with its borrowed light. Here
and there a low island, reclaimed from the sea.
by the patient toil of a thousand years, dotted
the Lagunes, burdened by the group of some
conventual dwellings, or picturesque with the
modest roofs of a hamlet of the fishermen.
Neither oar, nor song, nor laugh‚ nor flap of
sail, nor jest of mariner disturbed the stillness.
All in the noar view was clothed in midnight
loveliness, and all in the distance bespoke the
solemnity of nature at peace. The city and
the Lagunes, the gulf and the dreamy Alps,
the interminablc plain of Lombardy, and the
blne void of heaven lay alike in a common
and grand repose.

 

THE PRAIRIE: FIREJ
FROM “THE BRAVO.”

VERY few moments sufficed to lay bare pan of his rifle. The light combustible kindled

a spot of some twenty feet in diameter.

Into one edge of this little area the trap-
per brought the females, directing M iddleton
and Paul to cover their light and inflammable
dresses with the blankets of the party. So
soon as this precaution was observed, the old
man approached the opposite margin of the
“ grass, which still environed them in a tall and
dangerous circle, and selecting a handful of
the driest of the herbage, he placed it over the

at the flash. Then he placed the little flame
into a bed of the standing sog, and withdraw-
ing from the spot to the centre of the ring, he
patiently awaited the result.

The subtle element seized with avidity upon
its new fuel, and in a moment forked flames
were gliding among the grass, as the tongues
of ruminating animals are seen rolling among
their food apparently in quest of its sweetest
portions.
