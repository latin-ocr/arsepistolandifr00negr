THOMAS DUNN ENotlsH.
Author of “Ben Bolt.’'

Δ ,Γ , greSS, poet and novelist, evidently a many-sided man, was born

(Ml, in philadelphia, June 29, 1819. He received the degree of M.
&Q D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1839, was called to the
*⁰3⁹ bar in 1842, and subsequently was a practicing physician at
Fort Lee, New Jersey. He was for years devoted to literary
pursuits as author, editor, and contributor to various periodicals. His
vigorous poem, “The Gallows-Goers,‘’ made a great sensation about 1845,
when capital punishment was an exciting subject of popular debate. A
selection from his historica] poenis was published in New York in 1880
under the title of “ American Ballads.'’

“ Ben Bolt'’ was written in 1842. Its author was visiting in New
York, and N. P. Willis who, with George P. Morris, was editing the
“ New Mirrorss' asked him for a gratuitous contribution, and suggested
that it be a sea-song. Mr. English promised one, and on returning to
his home attempted to make good his word. Only one line that smacked
of the sea came at his bidding 3 but at a white heat he composed the five
stanzas of “ Ben Bolt,'' as it now reads, betraying the original intention
in the last line of the last stanza.

within a year the poem had been reprinted in England, and its
author then thought it might be a still greater favorite if set to appro-
priate music. One musical composer wrote an air for it, which was
never printed, and Mr. English wrote one himself which, although printed,
had no sale. It was written entirely for the black keys. In 1848 a play
was brought out in Pittsburg, Pa., called “ The Battle of Buena Vista,‘'
in which the song of “Ben Bolt '' was introduced. The air to which the

words were sung became popular, and although the drama died, the song
survived.
