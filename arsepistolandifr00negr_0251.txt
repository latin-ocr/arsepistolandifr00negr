The desire to do something was not eonfined
to Tem. Every servant in the establislnnent
showed the same feeling, and in their way did
what they could. But the friend who knew
most of Eva's own imaginings 31111 fore-
shadowings was her faithful bearer, Tem. To
him she said what she would not 1115111111 her
father by saying. To him she imparted those
mysterious intimatione which the 50111 feels as
the cords begin to unbind ere it leaves its clay
forever.

Toni, at last, would not sleep in his room,
11111 lay all night in the outer 1161311113, ready
to rouse at every call.

“ Uncle Toni, what alive have you taken to
sleeping any where and everywhere, like a 1108,
for? ’' said Miss Ophelia. “ Ι thought you
was one of the orderly sort that· liked to lie in
bed in a Christian way.’'

“I do, Miss Feely, said Tom, mysteriously.
“ I do ς but now—'’

“ Well, what now ? ''

“ We mustn’t speak loud ; Mas'r St. Clare
won't hear on't. But Miss Feely, you know
there must be somebody watchin' for the
bridegroom.'’ ’

“ What do you mean, Tom ἶ) ”

“ Yon know it- says in Scriptum, ‘At mid-
night there was a great cry made. Behold,
the bridegroom cometh.’ That’s what I’m
spectin’ now every night, Miss Feely, and Ι
couldn’t sleep out o’ hearin', no ways.'’

“ Why, Uncle Tom, what makes you think
so?''

“Miss Eva, she talks to me. The Lord,
he sends his messenger in *the soul. Ι 1111151
116 11131, Μί55 Feely; for when that ar blessed
child goes into the kingdom, they’ll open the

said Tom, quoting from a favorite hymn.

This dialogue passed between Miss Ophelia
and 'l'oin between ten and eleven 0116 evening,
after lter arrangeinents had all beon 1113116 sor
the night, when, 011 going to holt 111-1011161·

the outer voranda.

She was not nervous or in11›1·essil)l‹·‚ but the
solemn, heartfelt manner s ruek her. Era
had been unusually bright and eheersul that
afternoon‚ and had sat raised in her bed and
looked over all her little trinkets and precium
things 31111 designated the friends to whom
she would have 1116111 given, and her manner
was more animated and her voice more natural
than they had known it for weeks. Her
father had been in in the evening and had
said that Eva appeared more like her former
sels than ever she had done since her sici<-
ness3 and when he kissed her for thenight 116
said to Miss Ophelia, “ Cousin, we may keep
her with 115 after all; she is· certainly
better:'’ and he had retired with a lighter
heart in his bosom than he had had there for
weeks.

But at midnight—strange, mystic hour!
when the veil between the frail present aad
the eterna] future grows thiu—then came the
messenger.

There was a sound in that chamber‚ first of
0116 who stepped quickly. It was Miss
Ophelia, who had resolved to sit up all night
with her little charge, and who at the turn of
the night had discerned what experienced
nurses significantly call “a change.⁵' The
outer door was quickly opened, and Tom,
who was watching outside, was on the alert in
a moment.

“ Go for the doctor, Tom. Lose not a

moment,’' said Miss Ophelia; and stepping

across the room she rapped at St. Clare's door. γ
