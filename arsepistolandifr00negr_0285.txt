ΟΝ BOARD THE OUMBERLAND.
MAROH 7, 1862,

“ STAND 10 your guns, men 1'' Morris cried; “ Ι ask but this ; 01 sink or swim‚

Small need 10 pass the word; Or live or nobly (116,
Our men 31 quarters ranged themselves My last sight upon earth may be
Before the drum was heard. To see that ensign fly 1 ’'
And then began 1116 sailors' jests: Meanwhile the shapeless iron mass
“What thing is that, I say?'' Came moving o'er the wave‚
“ A 'long-shore meeting-house adrift As gloomy as a passing hearse,
A standing down the bay ⁶? '' As silent as the grave.
“So 51101 your guns and point them straight: Her ports were closed ; from stem to 516111
Before this day goes by, No sign of life appeared:
We'll try of what her metal’s made.'' We wondered‚ questioned, strained our eyes,
A cheer was our reply. J oked—every thing, but feared.
‘⁴ Remember‚ boys,this flag of ours She reached our range. Our broadside rang
Has seldom left its place ; Our heavy pivots roared;
And where 11 falls, the deck it strikes And 51101 and shell, a fire of hell,
Is covered with disgraoe. Against her side we poured.
