Side by side, for the way was one ς

The toilsome journey of life was done;
And all who in Christ the Saviour died,
Came out alike 011 the other side.

No gowns of silk or suits of gray;

No creeds to guide them, or MSS. ;

I WOULD NOT LIVE ALWAY.
ΒΥ WILLIAM AUGUSTUS MUHLENBERG.

gelical Catholic Union.’'

Born in Philadelphia, September 16, 1796, and died in New York‚

April 8. 1877. His best known pen production is the following sacred lyric :

WOULD not live alway, live alway below!
Oh no, I'll linger not when bidden to go ;
The days of our pilgrimage granted us here

Are enough for life’s woes‚ full enough for its
Wouldtlhghlrink from the path which the pro·
phets of God‚
Apostles and martyrs so joyfully trod?
Like a spirit unblest o'er the earth would I
While {ideali-ren and friends are all hastening
ome ἶ)

Ι would not live alway—I ask not to stay
Where storm after storm rises dark o'er the

way ;

I would not live alway—no‚ welcome the tomb!
Since Jesus hath lain there Ι dread not its

Wheregliceodleigned to sleep I’ll, too, bow my
All pegggfc'iil to slumber on that hallowed
Then tlhzd glorious daybreak to follow that

nicht,
The 01161131 3163111 of the angels of light,
With their clarion call for the 516611615 to rise
And ebant forth their matins away to the skies.

Who, who would live alway——away from 1115
Away ffiffffyon heaven, that blissful abode ;

Where, secking for rest, we but hover around 11711616 1116 rivers of pleasure flow o'er the

Like the patriarch's bird, and no resting is 1

Wherefliolgg 'when she paints her gay bow in
the air,

Leaves its brilliance to fade in the night of

And josszsllthlliing angel ne'er sheds a glad ray
Save the gleam of the plumage that bears him
away.

I would not live alway, thus fettered by sin— ¹
Temptation without and corruption within 3 ³

In a moment of strength if I sever the chain,

Scarce the victory is mine ere I'm captive again.

E'en the rapture of pardon is mingled with
fears

And the cup of thanksgiving with penitent
tears

The festival'trump calls for jubilant songs,

But my spirit her own miserere prolongs.

11113111 11131115,
And the noontide of glory eternally reigns;
11711616 1116 saints of all ages iu harmony meet,
Their Saviour and brethren transported to
greet,
While 1116 501135 of salvation exultingly roll,
And the smile of the Lord is the feast of the

soul ?

That heavenly music! Hark! sweet in the air

The “hal-ps of the harpers'' I hear ringing
there !

And see soft unfolding those portals of gold,

The King all arrayed in his beauty behold 1

Oh, give 1116-011, give 1116 1116 wings of a dove

To adore him, be near him, enrapt with his
love,

I but wait for the.summons, I list for the
word—

Alleluia! Amen 1 Evermore with the Lord.
