lineage, some with armor on their breasts,
and others with stately ruffs and robes of
peace. All were characterized by the stern-
ness and severity which old portraits so in-
variably put on; as if they were the ghosts‚
rather than the pictures, of departed worthies,
and were gazing with harsh and intolerant
criticism at the pursuits and enjoyments of
living men.

At about the centre of the oaken paneis
that lined the hall was suspended a suit of
mail, not, like the pictures‚ an ancestral relic,
but of the most modern date 3 for it had been
inanufactured by a skillful armorer in Lon-
don the same year in which Governor Bel-
lingham came over to New England. There
was a steel headpiece, a ouh-ass, a gorget and
greaves, with a pair of gauntlets and a sword
hanging beneath; all, and especially the
helmet and breastplate, so highly burnished
as to glow with white radiance and scatter
an illumination everywhere about upon the
floor.

This bright panoply was not meant for
mere idle show, but ha'd been worn by the
governor on many a solemn muster and
training field, and had glittered, morecver,
at the head of a regiment in the Pequod war.
For, though bred a lawyer, and accustomed

as his professional associates‚ the exigencies
of this new country had transformed Gov—
ernor Bellingham into a soldier, as well as a
statesman and ruler.

Little Pearl———who was as greatly pleased
with the gleaming armor as she had been
with the glittering frontispiece of the house
—spent some time looking into the polished
mirror of the breastplate.

“Momm-‚³⁷ cried she, “I see you here
Lookl 110οκ I ''

Hester looked, by way of humoring the
child; and she saw that, owing to the pecu—
liar effect of this 00ονοΧ mii-ror, the scarlet
letter was represented in exaggerated and
gigantic proportione, so as to bc greatly the ,
most prominent feature of her appearance.
In truth‚ she seemed absolutely hidden be-
hind it.

Pearl pointed upward, also, at a similar
picture in the headpiece, smiling at her mo-
ther with the elfish intelligence that was so
familiar an expression 011 her small physiog-
nomy. That look of naughty merriment
was likewise reflected in the mirror, with so
much breadth and intensity of effect, that it
made Hester Prynne feel as if it could not
be the image of her own child, but of an imp
who was seeking to mold itself into Pearl's
shape.

 

MOSSES FROM AN

HE Old Mansel——we had almost forgot-
T ten it; but will return thither through
the orchard. This was set out by the
last clergyman, in the declines of his life,
when the neighbors laughed at the hoary-
headed man for planting trees from which he
could have no prospect of gathering fruit,
Even had that been the case, there was only
so much the better motive for planti ng them,
in the pure and unselfish hope of benefiting
his successors--an end so seldom achieved by
more ambitious efforts. But the old minister,
before reaching his patriarchal age of ninety,
, ate the apples from this orchard during many
years, and added silvei· and gold to his-annual
stipe-nd by disposing of the superfluity.

OLD MANSE.

It is pleasant to think of him, walking
among the trees in the quiet afternoons of early
autumn, and picking up here and there a
wind-fall ; while he observes how heavily the
branches are weighed down, and computes
the number of empty flour—barrels that will be
filled by their burdcn. He loved each tree,
doubtleSS‚ as if it had been his own child.
An orchard has a relation to mankind, and
readily connects itself with matters of the
heart. The tree possessos 0 domestic char-
acter ; they have lost tho wild nature of their
forest kindred, and have grown humanized
by receiving the care of man, as well as by
contributing to his wants.
