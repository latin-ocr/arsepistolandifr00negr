ALFRED TENNYSON. 463

him a stronger hold upon the affections of the reading public. More
abrupt, more vigorous in thought, more rugged and massive as a poet
than Longfellow, his versification was yet easy and graceful, although
inferior in this respect to that of our own great poet, just mentioned,
whose name is a household word everywhere. Tennyson died October
6th, 1892.

The eminent critic, Mr. R. H. Hutton, speaks as follows of England's
late renowned laureate :

“ Lord Alfred Tennyson has been called the Shakespeare of his time.
It is somewhat invidious to compare him with any poet who ever lived,
He is a mountain summit by himself, standing alone, maj estic and grand,

and grace.

“Not exactly cypress, but a wreath of weeping willow, should ι
encircle his name. He is enamored with ideal beauty and purity of soul‚
and he sings the praises of holy and exalted friendship more than the
warmer passion of love. He may be characterized as an elevated philos-
opher with a poet's expression, which a delicate perception of the beauti-
ful and true has given him.

“ His harp is not strung with strings whose wild, loud notes shall
first awaken, and then petrify the snoring world, but with silken, silvery,
