DINAH THE METHODIST.
FRoM “ADAM Ennia„

EVERAL of the men followed Ben's
lead, and the traveller pushed his horse
on to the Green, as Dinah walked rather

quickly, and in advance of her companions,
toward the cart under the maple tree. While
she was near Seth’s tall figure she looked
short, but when she had mounted the cart,
and was away from all com parison, she seemed
above the middle height of woman,though in
reality she did not exceed it—an effect which
was duc to the slimness of her figure, and the
simple line of her black stuff dress.

The stranger was struck with surprise as
he saw her approach and mount the cart-—
surprise, not so much for the feminine delicacy
of her appearance, as at the total absence of
sels-consciousness in her demeanor. He had
made up his mind to see her advance with a
measured step, and a demure solemnity of
countcnance3 he had felt sure that her face
would be mantled with a smile of conscious
saintship, or else charged with denunciatory
bitterness. He knew but two types of Meth-
odist— the ecstatic and the bilions

But Dinah walked as simply as if she were
going to market, and seemed as unconscious
of her outward appearance as a little boy;
there was no blnsh, no tremulousness, which
said, “ I know yon think me a pretty woman,
too young to preach ; '² no casting up or down
of the cyelids, no compression of the lips, no
attitude of tho arnis, that said, ‘⁸' But you
must needs think of me as a saint.'’

She held no book in her ungloved hands,
but let them hang down lightly crossed before
her, as she stood and turned her grey eyes on
the people. There was no keenness in her
eyes; they seemed rather to be shedding love
than making observations ; they had the liquid
look which tells that the mind is full of what
it has to give out, rather than impressed by
external objects.

The eyebrows, of the same color as the hair,
were perfectly horizontal and firmly pencilled ς
the eyelashes‚ though no darker‚ were long
and abundant; nothing was left blurred or

unfinished.
It was one of those faces that make one

think of white flowers with light touches of

color on their pure petals. The eyes had no
peculiar beauty, beyond that of expression;
they looked so simple, so candid, so gravely
loving, that no accusing scowl, no light
sneer, could help melting away before their
glauce.

Joshua Rann gave a long cough, as if he
were clearing his throat in order to come to
a new understanding with himself ; Chad
Cranage lifted up his leather skull-cap, and
scratched his head; and Wiry Ben wondered
how Seth had the pluck to think of court-
ing her.

“ A sweet woman,’' the stranger said to him-
self, “ but surely Nature never meant her sor
a preacher.’'
