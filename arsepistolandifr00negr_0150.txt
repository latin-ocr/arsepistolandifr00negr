trouble in the world as that of finding myself,
with only the two or three mouths which it
was my privilege to feed, the sole inheritor of
the old clergyman's wealth of fruits. Through-
out the summer there were cherrics and cur-
rants ; and then came autumn, with his im-
mense burden of apples, dropping them con-
tinually from his overladen shoulders as he
trudged along. In the stillest afternoon, if Ι
listened, the thump of a great apple was audi-
ble, falling without a breath of wind, from the
mere necessity of perfect ripeness. And, be-
sides, there were pear-trees, that flung down
bushels upon bushels of heavy pears; and
peach-trees, which, in a good year, tormented
me with peaches, neither to be eaten nor kept,
nor, without labor and perplexity, to be given
away.

The idea of an infinite generosity and in-
exhaustible bounty, on the part of our mother
nature, was well worth obtaining through such
cares as these. That feeling can be enjoyed in
perfection not only by the natives of summer
islands, where the brem-fruit, the cocoa, the
palm and the orange grow spontaneously, and
hold forth the ever-ready meal ; bnt, likewise‚
almost as well, by a man long habituated to

fruit of trees that he did not plant 3 and
which, therefore, to my heterodox taste, bear
closer resemblance to those that grew in Eden.

Not that it can be disputed that the light
toil requisite to cultivate a moderately sized
garden imparts such zest to kitchen vegetables
as is never found in those of the market-
gardener. Childless men, if they would know
something of the bliss of paternity, should
plant a seed—be it squash‚ bean, Indian corn,
or perhaps a mere flower, or worthless weed—
should plant it with their own hands, and
nurse it from infancy to maturity‚ altogether
by their own care. If there be not too many
of them, each individual plant becomoe an
object of separate interest.

My gai-den, that skirted the avenue of the
Manse was of precisely the right extent. An
hour or two of morning labor was all that it
required. But I used to visit and revisit it a
dozen times a day, and stand in deep contem-
plation over my vegetable progeny, with a
love that nobody could share or conceive of
who had never taken part in the process of
creation. It was one of the most bewitching
sights in the world to observe a hill of beans
thrusting aside the soil, or a row of early peas

city life, who plunges into such a solitude as just peeping forth sufficiently to trace a line
that of the Old Manse, where he plucks the of delicate green.

THE VERNAL SEASON.

HANK Providence for spring ! The earth
—and man himself, by sympathy with
his birthplace—-would be far other than

we find them, if life toiled wearily onward,
without this periodica] infusion of the primal
spirit. Will the world ever be so decayed
that spring may not renew its greenness?
Can man be so dismally age-stricken that no
faintest sunshine of his youth may revisit him
once a year? It is impossible. The moss on
our time-worn mansion brightens into beauty;
the good old pastor, who once dwelt here,
renewed his prime, regained his boyhood, in
the genial breezes of his ninetieth spring.

Alas for the worn and heavy soul, if,
whether in youth or age, it have outlived its
privilege of springtime sprightliness! From
such a soul the world must hope no refor-
mation of its evil—no sympathy with the
lofty faith and gallant struggles of those who
contend in its behalf. Summer works in the
present, and thinks not of the future; autumn
is a rich conservative; winter has utterly lost

its saith, and clings tremulously to the remem-
brance of what has been ; but spring, with its
outgushing life, is the true type of the move-
ment.
