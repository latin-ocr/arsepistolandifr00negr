So, with an equal splendor, Sadly, hut not with upbraiding.
The morning sun-mys· f..ll‚ The generous deed was done ;
With a touch impartially temler, In the storrn of the years that are sarlius,
On the blossonis blooming for all 2— No braver battle was won 2-—
Under the s d and the (lew, Under the sod and the dew
Waiting ihc judgnieut day ; Waiting the judgment day;
Broidered with gold, the Blue, Under the blossoins, the Bluc,
Mellowed with gold, the Gray. Under the garlands, the Gray.
’ So when the summer calleth, No more shall the war cry sever,
On forest and field of grain, Or the winding rivers be red ;
With an equal murm nr falleth They banish our anger forever [dead 1
The cooling drip of the rain :-— When they laurel the graves of our
Under the sod and the dew, Under the sod and the dew,
Waiting the judgment day ; Waiting the judgment day ;
Wet with the rain, the Blue, Love and tears for the Blue,
Wet with the rain, the Gray. Tears and love for the Gray.

THE STAR. SPANGLED BANNER.
BY FRANCIS sco'rT KEY.

In 1814, when the *Eritish fleet was at the mouth of the Potomac River, and intended to
attack Baltimore‚ ΜΓ. Key and Mr. Skinner were sent in a vessel with a flag of truce to
obtain the release of some prisoners the English had taken in their expedition against lVash-
ington. They did not succerd, and were told that they would be detained till after the
attack had been made on Baltimore. Accordingly, they went in their own vessel‚ strongly
guarded, with the British fleet, and when they came within sight of Fort MvHenry, a short
distance below the city, they could see the American flag flying on the ramparts.

As the day closed in, the bombardmcnt of the fort commenced‚ and Mr. Key and Mr.
Skinner remained on deck all night, watching with deep anxiety every shell that was tired.
While the bombardment continued, it was sufficient proof that the fort had not surrendered.
It suddenly eeased some time before day ; but as they had no communication with the enemy’s
ships, they did not know whether the fort had surrendered. or the attack had been abandoned·

At length the light earne, and they saw that “our flag was still there‚'' and soon they
were informed that the attack had failed. In the fervor of the momen-t, Mr. Key took an old
letter from his pocket, and on its back wrote the most of this celebrated song, finishing it as
soon as he reached Baltimore. He showed it to his friend Judge Nicholson‚ who was so pleased
with it that he placed it at once in the hands of the printer, and in an hour after it was all
over the city, and hailed with enthusfflsm, and took its place at once as a national song.

Thus, this patriotic, impassioned ode became forever associated with the “Stare and
StripeS.’'

SAY can you see, by the dawn's early And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting

light, in air,
What so proudly we hailed in 'the Gave proof through the night that our flag
twilight’s last gleaining? was still there.
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through O, say, does that star-spangled banner yet
the perilous fight, wave
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly O’er the land of the free and the home of
