HELEN HUNT JACKSON. 127

THE NEWSBOY’S DEBT.

NLY last year, at Christmas time,
While pacing down a city street,
Ι saw a tiny, ill-clad boy—

One of the thousands that we meet—

He stood and gazed with wistful face,
All a child’s longing in his eyes;

Then started, as Ι touched his arm,
And turned in quick, mechanic wise.

Raised his torn cap with purple hands,
Said, “ Paper, sir? Stin, Star, Times! ”
And brushed away a freezing tear
That marked his cheek with frosty rimes.

“How many have you? Never mind—
Don’t stop to count—I’ll take them all ;
And when you pass my office here
With stock on hand, give me a call.”

He thanked me with a broad Scotch smile,
A look half wondering and half glad.

I fumbled for the proper ‘⁴ change,''
And said, “ You seem a little lad

“To rough it in the streets like this.’'
“ I’m ten years old this Christmas time 1 ”
“Your name?'’ “ Jim Hanley.’'
bill—

I’ve nothing else, but this one dime—

“Five dollars. When you get it changed
Come to my office —that's the place.
Now wait a bit, there's time enough z
You need not run a headlong race.

“Where do you live?'’ “ Most anywhere.
We hired a stable loft to-day,

Me and two others.’' “And you thought
The fruiter's window pretty, hey?

“And you are cold ? ’⁹ “ Aye, just a bit.

Ι don’t mind cold.'’ “ Why, that is strange !'’

He smiled and pulled his ragged cap,
And darted off to get the “change''

So, with half unconscious sigh,
I sought my office desk again.
An hour or more my busy wits
ζ , Found work enough with book and pen.

1 But when the mantel clock struck five
’ Ι started with a sudden thought,

‘⁴ Here's a

For there beside my hat and cloak
Lay those six papers Ι had bought.

“thy, where’s the boy, and where's the
He shblhzldgliave brought an hour ago?

Ah, well! ab, well! they’re all alike!
I was a fool to tempt him so!

‘¹ Dishonest! well, Ι might have known;
And yet his face seemed candid, too.
He would have earned the difference
If he had brought me what was due.'’

Just two days later, as I sat,
Half d ozing in my office chair,
Ι heard a timid knock‚ and called,
In my brusque fashion, “VVho's there?’'

An urchin entered, barely seven-
The same Scotch face, the same blue eyes—-
And stood half doubting, at the door,
Abashed at my forbidding guise.

“ Sir, if you please, my brother ‹Tim-—
The one you gave the bill, you know-

He couldn’t bring the money, sir,
Because his back was hurted so.

“ He didn't mean to keep the ‘ change,'
He got runned over up the street;

One wheel went right across his back,
And t'other fore-wheel mashed his feet.

·‘ They stopped the horses just in time,
And then they took him up for dead3
And all that day and yesterday
He wasn't rightly in his head.

‘¹ They took him to the hospital—

One of the newsboys knew ’twas J im·-
And I went too, because, you see,

We two are brothers, Ι and him.

“ He had that money in his hand,
And never saw it any more.
Indeed, he didn't mean to steal!

He never lost a cent before.

“He was afraid that you might think
He meant to keep it any way.

This morning, when they brought him to,
He cried because he couldn’t pay.
