THE: LATE} SPRING.

HE stood alone amidst the April fields—
Brown, sodden fieIds, all desolate and bare.

“ The spring is late‚'' she said, “the faith-
less spring, [fair.
That should have come to make the meadows

“Their sweet 8011111 left too soon, among the

The {Ji-{ili bewildered‚ flutter to and fro ;

For them no green boughs wait—their memories
Of last year's April had deceived them so.'’

 

She watched the homeless birds, the slow‚ sad
spring,

The barren fields, and shivering‚ naked trees,

‘⁴ Thus God has dealt with me, his child? she

I am His own—doth not my Father eare?''

 

THE HOUSE IN THE MEADOW.

T stands in a sunny mead0w‚
The house so mossy and brown,
With its cumbrous old stone offimneys,

And the gray roof sloping down.

The trees fold their green arms around it,—

The trees a century old ;
And the winds go ehanting through them,

And the sunbeams drop their gold.

The oowslips spring in the marshes,
The roses bloom on the hill,

And beside 1116 brook in the pasture
The herds go feeding at will.

Within, in the wide old kitohen,
The old folks sit in the sun,
That creeps through the sheltering woodbine,

Till the day is almost done.

Their children have gone and left them:
They sit in the sun alone!

And the old wife’s ears are failing
As she harks to the well-known tone

That won her beart in her girlhood‚
That has soothed her in many a care,

And praises her now for the brightness
Her old face used to wear.

She thinks again of her bridal,—
How, dressed in her robe of white,
She stood by her gay young lover
In the morning's rosy light.

O, the morning is rosy as ever,

But the rose from her eheek 15 fied3
And the sunshine still is golden‚

But it falls on a silvered headL
