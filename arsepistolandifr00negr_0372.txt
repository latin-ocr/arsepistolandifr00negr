, , ,’ AMOUS for his great debate with Daniel Webster in the Senate ἶ

of the United States‚ and as a master of sarcasm, invective 1
, and persuasive eloquence, Mr. Hayne stands out prominently Ι
“ in the history of the long struggle that finally culminated in
our Civil War. His speeches and orations rank with the best
productions of their kind. For along time he was the pride “
of his State, wielded a vast infiuence over the public mind, and both at
the bar and in Congress showed himself to be a formidable champion of .
whatever cause he advocated.

Mr. Hayne was born in the parish of Saint Paul, South Carolina‚ in
1791, and died in 1840. He became eminent as a lawyer, and in 1818
was chosen Speaker of the State Legislature. He represented South
Carolina in the National Senate from 1823 to 1832. In 1830 he made his

memorable reply to Webster. He was an advocate of nullification.
