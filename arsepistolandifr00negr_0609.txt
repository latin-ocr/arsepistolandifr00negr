As in his presence, ever to observe

His providence, and on him sole depend‚

Merciful over all his works, with good

Still overcoming evil, and by small [weak

Accomplishing great things, by things deemed

Subverting worldly strong and worldly wise

By simply meek 3 that suffering for truth's
sake

Is fortitude to highest victory,

And to the faithful death the gate of life;

Taught this by his example, whom I now

Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.

EVE ΤΟ ΑΒΑΜ.

With sorrow and heart's distress
Wearied, I fell aslcep. But now lead on ;

Who for my wilful crime art banished henco.

 

 

This further consolation, yet secure,

I carry hence; though all by me is lost⁷
Such favor Ι unworthy am vonchsafed
By me the promised Seed shall all restore.
