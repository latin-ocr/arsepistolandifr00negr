308 CHARLES FENNO HOFFMAN.

Philadelphia, and a fourth in London, in the same year. It placed him
in the front rank of American novelists. He describes in it, with remark-
able felicity, American forest life and savage warfare‚ and gives a truer
idea of the border contests of the Revolution than any former history of

the period that has been published.
The celebrated Knickerboeker Magazine was first published under

the editorial auspices of Mr. Hoffman. Several works issued from his
pen, all of which were well received. Although some of his pieces are
exquisitely finished, they have all evidently been thrown off without labor.
in moments of feeling. Griswold compares his melodies to the richest

of those written by Herrick and Waller.
In 1849 Mr. Hoffinan was attacked with a mental derangement‚ and

from that time his mind was under a cloud. He died at Harrisburg, Pa.,
June 7, 1884.

THE WESTERN HUNTER TO HIS LADY-LOVE.

wend, As we chase the deer by the blue lake-side,

WEN 1), love, with me, to the deep woods, I will sing thee many ajoyous lay,

NVhere far in the forest the wild
flowers keep,
Where 110 watehing eye shall over us bend,
Save the blossoms that into thy howel· peep.

Thon shalt 1111111101- from 1111115 of the oriole’s hue,

W hose {lamin g wings round our path way flit‚
From the saffron orchis and lupin 111110,
And those like the somn on my eourser's bit.

One steed and one saddle us both shall bear,
One hand of each on the bridle meet;

While the winds that over the prairie play
&hall fan the eheek of my woodland bride.

Our home shall be by the eool‚ bright streams,
there the beaver chooses her safe retreat,
And our hearth shall smile like the sun’s
warm gleams
Through the branehes around our lodge that
meet.
Then wend with me, to the deep woods wend‚
there far in the forest the wild flowers keep,

And beneath the 111151111111011111111105 me there, there no watehing eye shall over us bend,

An answering pulse from my heart shall beat.

Save the blossoms that into thy bower peep.

MONTEREY.

ἱ Ν ῙΕ were not many, we who stood
Before the iron 51001 that ‹lay3
Yet many a gallant spirit would

Give half 1115 years if but he 0011111
Have with 115 been at Monterey.

Now 11010, now there, the shot it hailed
In deadly drifts of fiery spray,

Yet 1101 a single soldier quailed

XVhen wonnded eorm-ades round him wailed
Their dying shout at Monterey.

And on, still 011, 0111 column kept

Thi-ough walls of flame its withering way;
XVhere fell the dead, the living stept,
Still eharging on the guns which swept

The slippery 5110015 of Monterey.

The foe himself reeoiled aghast‚
then, striking where he strongest lay,
We swooped his flanking batteries past,
And braving full their murderous blast,
Stormed home the towers of Monterey.
