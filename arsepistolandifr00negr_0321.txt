JOSEPH RODMAN DRAKE.

But left an arch of silver bright,
The rainbow of the moony main.

It was a strange and lovely sight
To see the puny goblin there;

He seemed an angel form of light,
With azure wing and sunny hair,
Throned on a cloud of purple fair,

Circled with blue and edged with white,

And sitting at the fall of even

Beneath the bow of summer heaven.

A moment, and its lustre fell ;
But ere it met the billow blue‚
He caught within his crimsou bell
A droplet of its sparkling dew—
a] oy to thee, Fay! thy task is done,
Thy wings are pure, for the gem is won—
Cheerfully ply thy dripping oar,
And hante away to the elfin shore.

He turns, and, lo, on either side
The ripples on his path divide;
And the track o’er which his boat must
pass,
Is smooth as a sheet of polished glass.
Around, their limbs the sea-nymphe
lave,
With snowy arms half-swelling out,
While on the glossed and gleamy wave
Their sea-green ringlets loosely float ;
They swim around with smile and song;
They press the bark with pearly hand,
And gently urge her course along,
Toward the beach of speckled saud ;
And, as he lightly leaped to land,
They bade adieu with nod and bow,
Then gayly kissed each little hand,
And dropped in the crystal deep below.

THE BRONX.

SAT ms down upon a green bank-side.
Skirting the smooth edge of a gentle
river,
Whose waters seemed unwilling to glide,
Like parting friends, who linger while they
sever;
Enforced to go, yet seeming still unready,
Backward they wind their way in many a
wistful eddy.

Gray o’er my head the yellow-vested willow
Ruffled its hoary top in the fresh breezes,
Glaucing in light, like spray on a green billow,

Or the fine frostwork which young winter
freezes;
When first his power in infant pastime trying,
Congeals sad autumn’s tears on the dead
branches lying.

The humbird shook his sun-touched wings
The {igelsriliich carolled in the still retreat;
The antio squirrel capered on the ground
Where lichens made a carpet for his feet;
Through ’the transparent waves, the ruddy
Shot urlinilnklglimmering sparks his red fin’s

tiny twinkle.

The breeze fresh springing from the lips of
morn,
Kissing the leaves, and sighiug so to lose ’em,
The winding of the merry locust’s horn,
The glad spring gushing from the rock’s
bare bosom ι
Sweet sighs‚ sweet sounds, all sights, all sounds
excelling,
O! ’twas a ravishing spot, formed for a poet's
dwelling.

And did Ι leave thy loveliness to stand
Again inv the dull world of earthly blind-
Painednvssil’tbh the pressure of unfriendly hands,
Siek of smooth looks, agued with icy kind-
ness?

Left I for this thy shades where none intrude,
To prison wandering thought and mar sweet
solitude?

Yet I will look upon thy face again,
My own romantio Bronx, and it will be
A face more pleasant than the face of men.
Thy waves are old companions‚ I shall see
A well-remembered form in each old tree,
And hear a voice long loved in thy wild
minstrelsy.
