300 WILL CARLETON.

And upon the dead sace smiling, with the
living one near by,
All the night a golden streamlet of the
moonbeams gently flowed!

One to live an· only orphan, one beneath the -
They fosiijlclldtsslielein in the morning on the dusty
Concord road.

 

OUR NATAL DAY.

H, the Fourth of July! NVhen Franklin——grand‚ droll—
When fire-crackers fly, That could lightnings control,
And urchinsinpctticoats tyrants defy! ἶ Comes here with his sturdy, progressive old
XVhen all tho still air soul:
Creeps away in despair, i then freedom's strong staff—
And clamor is king, hc the ‹lay ‹lark or fair!
then freedom's red flowcrs

F all in star-spangled showers‚

 

Hancock——with a laugh,
&Vrites in memory’s album his huge autograph !

 

And liberty capcrs sor twenty-four hours; But let thought have its way,
&Vlien the morn’s ushered in And give memory sway;
By asloep-crushing din, Do we think of the eost of this glorified day?
That tempts us to use philological sin ; While the harvest-field waves,
XVhen the forenoon advances Do we think of those braves
With large circumstances, In the farms thickly planted with thousands of
Subjecting our lives to debatable chauces ; graves?
then thc soldiers of peace How the great flag up there,
T heir attractions increase, Clean and pure as the air,
By marclnng, proten-:ted with clubs of police; Has been drabbled with blood-drops, and
then the little toy gun trailcd in despair?
Has its share of the fun,
By teaching short-hand to the favoritc son. ΒΟ WO kUOW What a land
God bath placed in our hand,
Oh, the Fourth of J uly ! To be madeinto star-gemas, or crushed intosand?
NVhen grand souls hover nigh! Let us feel that our race,
then NVashington bends from the honest blue Doomed to no second place,
sky ! Must glitter with triumph, or die in disgrace!
then Jefferson stands—- That millions unb0rn‚
Famous scribe of all lands— At night, noon, and morn,
The charter of heaven in his glorified hands! Will thank us with blessings, 01· curse us with
When his comrade—strong, high, scorn,
John Adams—comes nigh, For raising more high
(For both went to their rest the same Fourth of Freedom’s flag to the sky,

J uly l) Or losing forever the F ourth of J uly!
