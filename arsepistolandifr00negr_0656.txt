THE DAWN OF PEAGE.

FT off, put off your mail, O kings,

Your hands must learn a surer grasp,
Your hearts a better trust.

O, bend abac-k the lauce's point,
And break the helmet bar;

But not the note of war.

Upon tho grassy mountain paths
The glittering 110515 increase——

And victory, fair victory,

They come who publish peace.

Nor nursling from the nest.

flakes of vapor, which would in common day-

is then 110 liiuit to the multitude, and no
check 10 1110 intensity, of the hues assumed.

The whole sky from the zenith to the hori-
zon becomes one molten, mantliug sea of color
and fire; every black bar turns into massy
gold, every ripple and wave into unsullied,
shadowless crimson, and purple, and madet,
and colors for which there are no words in
language and no ideas in the mind—things
which can only be conceived while they 3ι·0
visible—the intense hollow blue of the upper
sky melting through it all—showing here deep
and pure and lightless, there modulated by
the filmy‚ formless body of the transparent
vapor, till it is lost imperceptibly in its crim-
son and gold.
