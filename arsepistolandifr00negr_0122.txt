of some wintry 011111, 301110 casual indisposition

bright in its foliage, but with the worm prey-

ing at its heart. We find it suddenly wither-
ing when it should be most fresh and luxuriant.
We see it dropping its branches to the earth
and shedding leaf by leaf3 until, wasted and
perished away, it falls even in the stillness of

the forest; and as we muse over the beautiful ,

ruin, we strive in vain to recollect the blast or
thunderbolt that could have smitten it with
decay.

PORTRAIT OF A DUTGHMAN.

HE renowned Wouter (or lValter) Van
'swiller was descended from a long line
of Dutch burgomasters, who had succes-

sively dozed away their lives, and grown fat
upon the bench of magistracy in Rotterdam,
and who had comported themselves with such
singular wisdom and propriety that they were
never either heard or talked of—which, next
to being universally applauded, should be the
object of ambition of all magistrates and rul-

ers.

There are two opposite ways by which some
men make a figure in the world: one by talk-
ing faster than they think ; and the other by
holding their tongues and not thinking at all.
By the first, many a smatterer acquires the
reputation of a man of quick parts; by the
other, many a dunderpate, like the owl, the
stupidest of birds, comes to be considered the
very type of wisdom. This, by-the-way, is a
casual remark, which I would not for the uni-
verse have it thought I apply to Governor Van
Twiller. It is true he was a man shut up
within himself, like an oyster, and rarely
spoke except 111 monosyllubles; but then it was
allowed hc seldom said a foolish thing.

So invincible was 1113 gravity that he was
never known to laugh, or even to smile,
through the whole course of a long and pros-
perous life. Nay, if a joke were uttered in his
presence that set light-minded hearers in a
roar, it was observed to throw him into a state
of perplexity. Sometimes he would deign to
inquire into the matter; and when, after much
explanation, the joke was made as plain as a
pile-staff, he would continue to smoke his pipe
111 silence, and at length, knocking out the

 

 

ashes, would exclaim, “ Well! I see nothing in
all that to laugh about! ''

The person of this illustrious old gentlenian
wus formed and proportioned as though it had
been moulded by the hands of some cunning
Dutch statuary, as a model of majesty and
lordly grandeur. He was exactly five feet six
inches iu height, and six feet five inches in cir-
cumference. His head was a perfect sphere,
and of such stupendous dimensions, that dame
Nature, with all her scx's ingenuity, would
have been puzzled to construet a neck capable
of supporting it; wherefore she wisely declined
the attempt, and settled it firmly on the back
of his back-bone, just between the shoulders.

His body was oblong, and particularly capa-
cious at bottom ; which was wisely ordered by
Providence‚ seeing that he was a man of
sedentary habits, and very averse to the idle
labor of walking. His legs were short, but

sturd y in proportion to the weight they had to
sustain ; so that when creet he had not a little

the appearance of a beer-barrel on skids. His
face—that infallible index of the mind--pre-
sented a vast expanse‚ unfurrowed by any of
those lines and angles which disfigure the
human countenance with what is termed
expression. Two small gray eyes twinkled

feebly in the midst, like two stars of lesser ·

magnitude in a hazy firmament3 and his full-

fed cheeks, which seemed to have taken toll of ’

everything that went into his mouth, were
curiously mottled and streaked with dusky
red, like a spitzenberg apple.

His habits were as regular as his person.
Such was the renowned Wouter Van Twiller
—a true philosopher.
