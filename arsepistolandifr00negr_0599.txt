THOMAS HOOD.

Wipe those poor lips of hers,
Oozing so clammily.

Loop up her tresses
Escaped from the comb—

Her fair auburn tresses—

Whilst wonderment guesses,
Where was her home?

Who was her father?
Who was her mother?
Had she a sister?
Had she a brother?
Or was there a dearer one

Still, and a nearer one
Yet, than all other?

Alas 1 for the rarity

Of Christian charity
Under the sun 1

Oh, it was pitiful!

Near a whole city full,
Home she had none,

Sisterly‚ brotherly‚
Fatherly, motherly
Feelings had changed—-
Love, by harsh evidence,
Thrown from its eminence ;
Even God's providence
Seeming estranged.

Where the lamps quiver
So far in the river,
With many a light
From window and casement,
From garret to basement,
She stood, with amazement,
Houseless by night.

The bleak wind of March

Made her tremble and shiver,

But not the dark arch,

Or the black‚ flowing river;

Mad from life's history,

Glad to death's mystery,
Swift to be hurled—

Anywhere, anywhere
Out of the world!

Ι11 she plunged boldly-

No matter how coldly
The rough river ran—-

Over the brink of it!

Picture it—think of it,
Dissolute inan!

Lave in it, drink of it
Then, if you can!

Take her up tenderly,
Lift 1101· with care;
F ashioned so slenderly‚
Young, and so fair!
Ere her limbs, frigidly,
Stiffen too rigidly‚
Decenssy, kindly,
Smooth and compose them,
And her eyes, close them.
Staring so blindly1—

Dreadfully staring

Through muddy impurity2.

As when with the daring
Last look of despairing
Fixed on futurity.

Perishing gloomily‚
Spurred by contumely‚
Cold inhumanity,
Burning insanity‚
Into her rest !
Cross her hands humbly,
As if praying dumbly,
Over her breast!

Owning her weakness‚
Her evil behavior‚

And leaving, with meekness?

Her sins to her Saviourl
