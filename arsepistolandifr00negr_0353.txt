THEODORE ROOSEVELT.

and was elected. He was elected Vice-President of the United States on
the McKinley ticket November 6, 1900.

Mr. Roosevelt’s first published work was a “ History of the United
States Navy,'' which is considered authority on the subject of which it
treats, and is written without partisan bias or those ignorant criticisms of
naval commanders which have so frequently characterized authors who
knew little or nothing of the officers of our navy and the part they per-
formed in active service. History should be a record of deeds, notos
individual opinions, Mr. Roosevelt is the author of a large and valuable
work, “The Winning of the &Vest‚'' and other works that are important
contributions to our literature.

THE FIGHT AT SANTIAGO.
FROM “THE nonen 11101111ον

HE fight was now on in good earnest and
T the Spaniards on the hills were engaged
in heavy volley firing. The Mauser
bullets drove in sheets through the trees and
tall jungle grass, making a peculial· whirring
, or rustling sound; some of the bullets seenied
to pop in the air so that we thought they were
explosive; and, indeed, many of those which
where coated with brass did explode, in the
ἲ sense that the brass coat was ripped off, making
a thin plate of hard metal with a jagged edge,
which inflicted a ghastly wound.

The shots were fired from rifles carrying
smokeless powder, The Mauser hullets them-
selves made a small clean holo, with the result
that the wound healed in a most astonishing
manner. One or two of our men who were
shot in the head had the skull blown open,
but elsewhere the wounds from the minute
steel-coated bullet, with its very high velocity,
were certainly nothing like as serious as those
made by the old large-calibre, low-power rifle.
If a man were shot through the heart, spine
or brain, he was, of course, instantly killed3
but very few of the wounded died-even
under the appaling conditions which pre-
vailed‚ owing to the lack of attendance and
supplies in the field-hospitals with the army.

While we were lying in reserve we were

suffering nearly as much as afterward when
we charged. I think that the bulk of the

Spanish fire was practically unaimed, or at
least not aiined at any particular inan, and only
occasionally at a particular body of meu 3 but
they swept the whole field of battle up to the
edge of the river, and inan after inan in our
ranks fell dead or Wouuded, although Ι had
the troopers scattered out sar apart taking
advantage of every scrap of cover.

Devereux was dangerously shot while he
sat with his 111011 on the edgc of the river. A
young lVest Point cadet, Ernest Has-keil, who
had taken his holiday with us as an acting
Second Limite-nant, was shot through the
steinach. He had shown great coolness and
gallantry, which he displayed to an even more
marked degree after being wouuded, shaking
my hand and saying: “All right, Colonel;
I'm going to get well. Don't hother about
me, and don't let any man come away with
1ne.'' then I shook hands with him I
thought he would surely die, yet he recovered.

The most serious loss that I, and the regi-
ment, could have suffered befell just before
we charged. Bucky O’Neill was strolling up
and down in front of his men smoking his
cigarette‚ for he was inveterately addicted to
the habit. He had a theory that an officer
ought never to take cover—a theory which
was, of course, wrong, though in a volunteer
organization the officers should certainly ex-
pose themselves very fully simply for the eflect
