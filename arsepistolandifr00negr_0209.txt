JOHN GODFREY SAXE. 161

One of the happiest exhibitions of his skill in language is in the
piece first printed in the Knickerbocker Magazine, commencing—

Singing through the forests,
Rattling over ridges,

Shooting under arches,
Rumbling over bridges;

Whizzing through the mountains‚
Buzzing o'er the vale—

Bless me ! this is pleasant,
Riding on a rail!

The whole composition is an echo and reflection of the crowded rail-
road car. ·

Mr. Saxe was elected* State's⁴ Attorney in 1851. A collection of his
poems appeared in 1849. They rank among the most successful pro-
ductions of their kind, and have obtained extensive popularity. A new
edition of his collective poems was published in 1864. He produced in
1866 “The Masquerade and other Poems‚’' and “ Leisure Day Rhymes ''

in 1875. He died March 31, 1887.

 

THE: PROUD MISS MaoBRIDE.

, TERRIBLY proud was Miss MaeBride,
The very personifioation of pride,
As she minoed along in fashion’s tide,
Adown Broadway—-on the proper side-
When the golden sun was setting;
There was pride in the head she carried so high,
Pride in her lip, and pride in her eye,
And a world of pride in the very sigh
That her stately bosom was fretting.

O, terribly proud was Miss MaeBride‚
Proud of her beauty, and proud of her pride,
And proud of fifty matters beside—

That wouldn’t have borne dissection :
Proud of her wit, and proud of her walk,
Proud of her 166111, and proud of her talk,
Proud of ‘⁴ knowing cheese from chalk,''

On a very slight inspection !

1 >old John Maenade, one fatal day,

ἱ Became the unresisting prey

Of Fortune's undertakers 3
ll

 

And staking all on a single die,
His foundered bark went high and dry
Among the brokers and breakers.

At his trade again, in the very shop

Where, years before, he let it drop,
He follows his ancient calling—-

Cheerily, too, in poverty's spite,

And sleeping quite as sound at night

A's when, at fortune’s giddy height,

He used to wake with a dizzy fright
From a dismal dream of falling.

But alas for the haughty Miss MacBride,
'Twas such a shock to her precious pride!
She couldn’t recover‚ although she tried

Her jaded spirits 10 rally :
’Twas a dreadful change in human affairs,
From a Plaee “ up town‚” 10 a 110011 ‘ up

stairs‚’'
From an avenne down 10 an 6116371-
