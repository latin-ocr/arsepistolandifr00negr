His eleva-

11011 to the peerage was inevitable3 he won it by his “ History of England '’

and other works.

This well—merited recognition of his pre-eminence in

the world of letters was not merely an official aet by government, but was
a spontaneous tribute from his appreciative countrymen.

THE REIGN OF TERROR.

OW began that strange period known by justify severity which, in ordinary times,

the name of the Reign of Terror. The

Jacobins had prevailed. This was
their hour and the power of darkness. Tho
convention was subjugated‚ and reduced to
profound silence on the highest questions of
state. The sovereignty passed to the Com-
mittee of Public Safety. To the edicts
framed by that Committee, the representative
assembly did not venture to ofl'er even the
species of opposition which the ancient Par-
liament had frequently offered to 1110 111011-
(10105 of the ancient kings.

Then 001110 those days, when the most bar·
bamus of all codes was administered by the
most barbarous of all tribunals; when 110
man could greet his neighbors, or say his
prayers⁷ or dress his hair, without danger of
committing a capital crime ; when spies lurked
in every corner3 when the guillotine was long
and hard at work every morning; when 1110
jails were filled as close as the hold of a slave
ship; and the gutters ran foaming with blood
into the Seine.

No mercy was shown 10 sex or age. The
number of young lads and of girls of seven-
teen who were murdered by that execrable
government, is to be reckoned by hundreds.
Babies, torn from the breast, were tossed from
pike to pike along the Jacobin ranks. One
champion of liberty had his pocket-s well
stuffed with ears. Another swaggered about
with the finger ofa little child in 1115 11111. Λ
few months had sufficed 10 degrade France
below the level of New Zealand.

It is absurd to say, that any amount of
public danger 0011 justify a system like this.
It is true that great emergencies call for
activity and vigilance; it 15 true that they

would dcserve the name of eruelty. But
indiscriminate severity can never, under any
circumstances, be useful. It is plain that the
whole eflicacy of punishment depends on the
care with which the guilty are distinguished.
Punishmcnt which strikes the guilty and the
innocent promiscuously, operatos merely like
a pestilence or a great convulsion of nature,
and has no more tendency to prevent offences,
than the cholera or an earthquake‚ like that
of Lisbon, would have.

The great Queeu who so long held her own
against foreign and domestic enemies, against
temporal and spiritual arms; the great Pro-
tector who governed with more than regal
power, in despite both of royalists and repub-
licans3 the great King who, with a beaten
army and an exhausted treasury, defended
his little dominions to the last against the
united eflbrts of Bassia, Austria, and F rance;
with what scorn would they have heard that
it was impossible for them to strikc a salutary
terror into the disass‘ccted‚ without sending
school-boys and school-girls to death by eart-
loads and boat-loads 1

To behead people by seoreS‚ without caring
whether they are guilty or innocent ; to wring
money out of the rich by the help of jailers
and executioners; to rob the public creditor,
and put him to death, if he remonstrates3 to
take loaves by force out of the bakers' shops3
to clothe and mount soldiers by seizing on oue
man's wool and linen, and on another man’s
horses and saddles‚ without compensation, is
of all modes of governing 1110 simplest and
most obvious. Of its morality, we, at present,
say nothing. But, surely, it requiris no
capacity beyond that of a barbarian or a child.
