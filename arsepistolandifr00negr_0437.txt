„lost CHANDLER HARffis.
Whose Pen-Name is ‘⁴ Uncle Remus'’

 

ξ R. HARRIS is an author who believes that all the materials for
humor and romance lie near at hand, and no American writer
has need to journey outside of his own country and people for
' “ characters and situations to furnish subject matter for his pen.
Among the Negroes of the South there are endless super-
stitions. traditions‚ curious characters and myths, Mr. Harris
conceived the happy idea of embodying these in sketches and tales, and
the result is a rich contribution to the literature that is distinctively
American.

He made a study of the folk-lore of the Negro race, discovered that
in some instances the same was found among the Indians of South
America, and that there are distinct traces of it even in Siain and India.
How these myths> stories and traditions should be found among races so
different and widely separated is an interesting problem. Mr. Harris has
aimed to portray the quaint characteristics of the Negro population‚
dwelling largely, as it was easy to do, on the humorous features of his
subject.

The little village of Eatonton‚ Georgia, is Mr. Harris’ native place.
Here, in circumstances not far removed from abject poverty, he was born
December 9, 1848. A favorite book of his boyhood was 'the “Vicar of
Wakefield‚'·’ and it inspired him at that early date to try his hand at
writing little storieS. For a time he was a typesetter on a country
newspaper.

⁷ Afterward he began his literary career by contributing to “ Lip—
pincott’s Magazine'’ an article on Negro folk-lore. He afterward wove
into his tales and sketches droll accounts of rabbits, foxes and other
animals common to the South. Many of these were published in the
well-known journal, the “ Atlanta Constitution‚'' a paper with which Mr.
Harris finally became connected. He studied law, and for a time pursued

his profession, but having a talent that pointed so plainly in another

direction. he soon devoted himself to journalism and authorship. 389
