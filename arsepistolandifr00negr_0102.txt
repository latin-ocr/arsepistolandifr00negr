He was a most sareastie man, ,this quiet Mr.
Brown,

FRANCIS BRET HARTE.

And the subsequent proceedings interested him

no more ;

And on several occasions he had cleaned out For, in less time than I write it, every member

the town.

Now, Ι hold it is not decent for a seientific gent

did engage

In a warfare with the remnants of the palaeozoic

age ;

To say another isan ass,—at least, to all intent; And the way they heaved those f033113‚in their

Nor should the individual who happens to be
Reply Ξῗῖἓξινίυς rocks at him, to any great
extent.

Then Abner Deum, of Angel's‚ raised a point
of order, when

A ehunk of old red sandstone took him in the
abdomen ;

And he smilvd a kind of sickly smile, and
curled up on the floor,

anger, was a sin,

'Till the skull of an old mammoth caved the

head of Thompson in.

And this is all I have to say of these improper

games,

For Ι live at Table Mountain, and my name

is Truthful J ames;

And I’ve told in simple language what I knew
about the row

That broke up our Society upon the Stanislow

 

DIGKENS IN GAMP.

BOVE the pines the moon was slowly ’
Α drifting,
The river sang below;
The dim Sierras, far beyond, uplifting
Their minarets of snow.

The roaring camp-fire, with rude humor,
painted
The ruddy tints of health

 

On ha ggard face and form that drocpcd and
fainted
In the fieree raee for wealth ;

Till one arose, and from his pack's scant treasure
A boarded volume drew,
And eards were dropped from hands of listless
leisure‚
To hear the tale anew;

And then, while round them shadows gathered
Aiidfjgtffhe firelight fell,

He read aloud the book wherein the Master
Had writ of “ Little Nell.’'

Perhaps 'twas boyish fancy—for the reader
VVas youngest of them all—

The fir-trees, gathering closer in tne shadows‚
Listened in every spray,
While the whole camp, with “ Nell,'’ on Eng-
lish meadows
Wandered and lost their way.

And so in mountain solitudes—o’ertaken
As by some spell divine——
Their cares dropped from them like the
needles shaken
From out the gusty pine.

Lost is that camp, and wasted all its fire:
And he who wrought that spell 1-

Ah, towering pine and stately Kentish spire,
Ye have one tale to tell!

Lost is that camp! but let its fragrant story
Blend with the breath that thrills

With hop-vines’ incense all the pensive glor}
That fills the Kentish hills.

And on that grave where English oak and

And &nivel wreaths intwine,

But, ns he read, from clustering pine and cedar Deem it not ull a too presumptuous folly—

Α :silence seemed to fall ;

This spray of western pine,
