ρῆῗᾶ HERE is no American author however great his name but would

ORATION OF· BRUTUS OVER THE BODY OF LUGRE'I'IA.

WOULP you know why 1 have sum-

moned you together?
Ask ye what brings 1110 here?

hold this dagger,
Clotted with gore! Behold that frozen 001501
See where the lost Lucretia sleeps in death !
She was the mark and model of the time,
The mould in which each female face was formed
The very shrine and sacristy of virtue!
Fairer than ever was a form created
By youthful fancy when the blood strays wild,
And never-resting thought is all on fire!
The worthiest of the worthy ! Not the nymph
Who met old Numa in his hollowed walks‚
And whispered in his ear her strains divine,
Can I conceive beyond her—the young choir
Of vestal virgins bent to her.

Be-

’Tis wonderful
Amid the darneL hemlock‚ and the base weeds,
Which now spring rife from the luxurious
compost

Spread o’er the realm, how this sweet lily rose «-

How from the shade of those ill-neighboring · γ

11111115
Her futhei· sheltered her, that not a leaf
VVas blightcd, but, arrayed in purest grace,

She bloomed unsullied beauty. Such per- ’

sections

Might have called back the torpid breast of age ·

To long-forgotten 1·apture; such a mind
Might have abashed the boldest hbertine
And turned desire to reverential love
And holiest affection!

O my countrymen !

You all can witness when that she went forth ·,

It was a holiday in Rome; old age
Forgot its crutch‚ labor its task—all ran,

And mothers‚ turning to their daughters, cried, ᾗ ·

“ There, there’s Lucretia!”

Now look ye
where she lies! ¹

That beauteous flower, that innocent sweet ζ

1050,

Torn up by ruthless violence·- gone! gone 1 gone! ’ζ
