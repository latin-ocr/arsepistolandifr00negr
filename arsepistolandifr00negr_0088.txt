62 EDGAR ALLAN POE.

lVanderers in that happy valley
Through two luminous windows saw
Spirits moving mnsieally,
To a lute's weil-tuned law;
Romul about a throne, where, sitting
(porphyrogene 1)
In state his glory well-befitting,
The ruler of the realm was seen.

And :ill with pearl and ruby glowing
lVas the fair palace-door,
Thi-ough which came flowing, flowing. flowing,
And sparkling evermore,
A troop of echoes, whose sweet duty
XVas but to sing,
In voices of surpassing beauty,
The wit and wisdom of their king.

’ But evil things, in robes of sorrow,
¹ Assailed the monarcli's high ‹state3

(Ah 1 181 115 mouru, for never mort-ow
Shall dawn upon him, desolate 1)
Α11(1 round about his home the glory
That blushed and bloomed,
Is hut a dim-rememhered story
Of the old time entombed.

And ‚travellers now within that valley,

¹ Through the red-litten windows 588

Vast forms, that move fantastieally

¹ To a discordant melody;
While, like a rapid, ghastly river,

Through the pale door,

1 Α hideons throng rosh out for ever,

And laugh—but smile no more.

 

THE BELLS.

In his poems Poe often gave expression to a favorite coneeit, which was the adaptation of
the words and rhythni not merely to the sense, hut to sound. The following poem if read
by a trained elocutionist (and it is one of the very hest for a skillful reader), would so fully
reproduce the sounds of ‘⁴ The Bells '⁷ that the listener could easily imagine he heard them in

the distance.

13 A It the sledges with the bells,
Η Silver 1181151 [foretellsl
What 11 world of merriment their melod y
How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle‚
In the icy air of night!
While the stars that oversprinkle
All the heavens seem to twinkle
With a erystalline delight;
Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of Runie rhyme,
To the 111111111111111118111111 that so musically wells

From the 118115, 118115, 118115, belis,
Bolis, belis, bells, [bells.
From the jingling and the tinkling of the

Hear the mellow wedding bells—
Golden bells' [tells!
what a world of happiness their harmony fore-
Throngh the 11111111)ν air of night
How they ring 0111 their delight!
From the molten-golden 1111185,
And all in tune,
What a liquid ditty floats [gloats
To the tnrtle-dove that listens‚ while she
On the moon 1

 

Oh, from out the sounding cells,
What 11 gnsh ofeuphony voluminously wells!
How it swells!
How it dwells
On the future ! how it tells
Of the rapture that impels
To the swinging and the ringing
Of the bells‚ bells. bells—
Of the bells, bells‚ bells, bells,

Bells, bells, 118115-
To the rhyming and the ehiming ofthe bolis!

Henr the loud alarum bells—
Brazen 1181151 ¹ [rel'sz
What a tale of terror, now, their turb-ulency
In the startled ear of night
How they seream out their affright 1
Too much horrified to speak,
They can only shriek, shriek‚
Out of tune, Hire,
In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the
In a mad expostulation with the deaf and
frantie fire
Leaping higher, higher, higher,
With a desperate desire,
