THE MAYFLOWER.

ETHINKS, I see it now, that one sol-
Μ itary, adventurous vessel, the “May—
flower'’ of a forlorn hope, freighted
with the prospects of a future state, and
bound across the unknown sea. I behold it
pursuing, with a thousand misgivings, the
uncertain, the tedious voyage. Suns rise and
set, and weeks and months pass, and winter
surprises them on the deep, but brings them
not the sight of the wished—for shore. I see
them now, scantily supplied with provisions,
crowded almost to 'suffocation in their ill-
stored prison, delayed by calms‚ pursuing a
circuitous route; and now, driven in fury
before the raging tempest, in their scarcely
seaworthy vessel. The awful voice of the
storm howls through the rigging. The labor-
ing masts seem straining from their base 3 the
dismal sound of pumps is heard; the ship
leaps, as it were, madly from billow to billow ;
the ocean breaks, and settles with ingulfing
fioods ox er the floating deck, and beats with
deadening weight against the staggerin g vessel.
I see them escape from these perils, pursuing
their allbut desperate undertaking, and lauded
at last, after a five—months’ passage, on the
ice-clad rocks of Plymouth‚ weak and ex-
hausted from the voyage, poorly arwed, scan-
'tily provisioned, depending on the charity of
their ship-master for a draught of beer on
board, drinking nothing but water on shore,
without shelter‚ without means, surrounded by
hostile tribes.

 

Shut now the volume of history, and tell
me, on any principle of human probability,
what shall be the fate of this handful of
adventurm-s? Tell me, men of military science,
in how many months they were all-swept off
by the the thirty savage tribes enumerated
within the boundaries of New England ’.Ρ Tell
me, politiciai1, how long did this shadow ot
a colony, on which your conventions and
treaties had not smiled‚ languish on the dis-
tant coast?

Student of history, compare for me the
baffled projects, the deserted settlements, the
abandoned adventures of other times and
find the parallel of this? &Vas it the winter
storm, beating upon the houseless heads of
women and children? l§Vas it hard labor and
spare meals‘? lVas it disease‘? *xVas it the
tomahauk? VVas it the deep malady of a
blighted hope, a ruined enterprise‚ and a
broken heart, aching in its last moments at
the recollections of the loved and left beyond
the sea? lVas it some or all of them united
that hurried this forsaken company to their
melancholy fate?

And is it possible, that neither of these
causes, that all combined were able to blast
this bud of hope! Is it possible that from
a beginning so feeble, so frail⁷ so worthy,
not so much of admiration as of pity, there
has gone forth a progress so steady, a growth
so wonderful, a reality so important, a promise
yet to be fulfilled so glorious!

 

MARTIN LUTHER.

N the solemn loneliness in which Luther
found himself, he called around him not
so much the masters of the Greek and

Latin wisdom through the study of the ancient
languages‚ as he did the mass of his own
countrymen‚ by his translation of the Bible.
It would have been a matter of tardy impres-
ι sion and remote efficacy, had he done no more
than awake from the dusty alcoves of the
libraries the venerable shades of the classic
teachers. He roused up a population of
6

 

living, sentient men, his countrymen, his
brethren.

He might have written and preached in
Latin to his dying day, and the elegant Italian
scholars‚ champions of the church, would have
answered him in Latin better than his own;
and with the mass of the people‚ the whole
affair would have been a contest between
angry and loquacious priests. “Awake all
antiquity from the sleep of the libraries l ''

Ha awoke all Germany and half of Europe
