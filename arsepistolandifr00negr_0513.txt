ALFRED TENNYSON. 465

Ο young lord-lover, what siglis are those The lilies and roses were all awake,
For one that will never be thine! They sighed for the dawu and thee.
But mine, but mine‚” so I sware to the rose,

‘⁴ Foreveg· and ever min01” Queeu-rose of the rose-bud garden of girls,

Come hither! the (lances are done3

In gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls,
Queen lily 111111 rose in one;

Shine out, little 111-1111, ¹sunning· over with ‹in-1⁵,
To the flowers and be their sun.

And the soul of the rose went into my blood,
As the music clashed in the hall ;

And long by the gai-den lake Ι stood,
For I heard your rivulet fall

From the lake to the n1ea‹low,an‹l on to the rffiwm has fallen a Splpndid tear

W00d’ , ‘From the passion 11011761 at the ζ15616.

To the woody hollows 111 which we meet And the lily WhiSPOES’ ιι 1 wast.»

And the valleys of Paradise.
She is cmning, my own, my sweet!

The slender acacia would not shake Were it ever so airy a tread,
One long milk-bloom on the 1166 ; My 1161111 would hear her and 116111,
The white lake-bloseom fell into the lake, lvere it earth 111 1111 earthly 11611 ;
As the pimpernel dozed on the lea; My (lust would hear 1161· and 116111,
Β111 1116 rose was awake all night for your 111111 Ι lain for a century ‹lead3
sake, XVould stnrt and tremble under her feet,
Knowing your promise to me; And blossoms in purple and red.

FLOW DOWN, GOLD RIVULE‘I'.

LOW down, cold rivulet‚ to 1116 sea, But here will sigh thine alder-tree‚
F Thy tribute-wave deliver : And here thine aspen shiver;
No more by thee my steps shall be. And here by thee 11111 1111111 the bee,
Forever and forever. For-ever and foi-ever.

Flow‚ softly flow, by lawn and lea, A thousand suns will stream on thee,
A rivulet, then a river; A thousand mouns will quiver:

Nowhere by thee my steps shall be, But not by thee my steps shall be,
Forever and forever. Forever aud sorever.

THE LAND OF LANDS.

OU ask me why though ill at ease, The land where, girt with friends or foes,
Withiu this region Ι subsist‚ A man may speak the thing 116 will :
XVhose spirits falter in the mist, A l nd f em d t
A nd languisb for the purple fleas. Σ lanz Οἳ. ju} ξὲἔθῶᾚῗῖἓᾶῃ,
It is the land that freemen till, there freedom broadens slowly down,
The sober-suited Freedom chose 5 From precedent to precedent :
