LESSINGS on the hand of woman! XVonran, how divine your mission,
Β Angels guard its strength and grace· Here upon 0111· natal sod 3
In 1110 11011100, cottage, hovcl‚ Keep—oh, keep the youngheart open
Oh, 110 matter where the place, Always to the breath of God 1
would that never 51011115 assailed it All true trophies of the ages
Itainbows ev‹·r gently curled‚ Are from mother love impearled,
For the hand that rocks the cradle For the hand that rocks the cradle
Is the hand that rules the world. Is the hand that rules the world.
Insancy's the tendet fountain, Blessings on the hand of woman!
Power may with beauty flow, Fathers, sons and daughters cry,
Mothers first to guide the streamlets, And the sacred song is ming-led
From thern souls unresting grow— With the worship in the sky——
Grow on for good or evil, Mingles where no tempest darkens,
Sunshine streamed or evil hurled, Rainbows evermore are hurled ε
For 1110 hand that rocks the cradle For 1110 hand that rocks the cradlo
15 the hand that rules the world. Is the hand that rules the world.

OLD FARMER GRUDGE.

LD Fssrmcr Grudge was determined '⁶0 But grumbled and growled‚and alwaysscowled
trudge At harvest over the meagre yield.

1¹¹ the 5³¹¹]ss 01‘] Wssy that his father And from the paltry store on the threshing
went:
TU toll {illd 110 SlaVe, 1⁴0 Pillssll sslld to save, Fronilogoarlging Inoxv and neglected bin,

Nor spend on a pleasure a single cent.

Would voices cry as he passed them by,
His tools were few, and so rnsty, too,

“ You can't take out what you don’t put

For want of the needsul drop of oil‚ ing„
That, creaky and slow, they were forced to go,
And added much ιο his dauy 1011. Old Farmer Grudge was a doleful drudge,

And in his dwelling and on his land,
His crops were scant, for he would not plant ’Twas plain to be seen, he was shrewd and keen,
Enough t.‹› cover his scanty field; And managed all with a miserly hand.
