NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE. 111

‘bury‚ where, with others, he appears to have been reconciled to the old
ways, as quite equal to the inventions of Fourier‚ Owen, and the rest of
that ingenious company of schemers, who were so intent upon a recon-
struction of the foundations of society. In 1843 he went to reside in the
pleasant village of Concord, in the “Old Manse,” which had never been
profaned by a lay occupant until he entered it as his home.

In his home at Concord‚ in the midst of a few congenial friends,
Hawthorne passed three years3 and, “ in a spot so sheltered from the tur-
moil of life's ocean,'' he says, “three years hasten away with a noiseless
flight, as the breezy sunshine chases the cloud-shadows across the depths
of a still valley.'' But at length his repose was invaded, by that “spirit
of improvement‚'' which is so constantly marring the happiness of quiet-
loving people, and he was compelled to look out for another residence.

Mr. Hawthorne added greatly to his fame by the publication of his
celebrated romance, “The Scarlet Letter,'' in 1850, and “The House of
Seven Gables '' in 1851. These may be called his masterpieces‚ and
“The Marble Faun,'’ which appeared in 1860, is well worthy to be classed
with them, and fully sustained his brilliant reputation. He died in 1864.

The characteristics of Hawthorne which first arrest the attention are
imagination and reflection, and these are exhibited in remarkable power
and activity in tales and essays, of which the style is distinguished for
great simplicity, purity and tranquility. He is original in invention,
construction, and expression, always picturesque‚ and sometimes in a high
degree dramatic. His favorite scenes and traditions are those of his own
country, many of which he has made classical by the beautiful associa-
tions that he has thrown around them. Every thing to him is suggest-
ive, as his own pregnant pages are to the congenial reader.

All his productions are life-mysteries‚ significant of profound truths.
His speculations, often bold and striking, are presented with singular
force, but with such a quiet grace and simplicity as not to startle until
they enter in and occupy the mind. The gayety with which his pensive-
ness is occasionally broken, seems more than any thing else in his works
to have cost some effort. The gentle sadness, the “half-acknowledged
melancholy,'' of his manner and reflections, are more natural and charac-
teristic.

, His style is studded with the most poetical imagery, and marked in

every part with the happiest graces of expression, while it is calm, chaste,
and flowing, and transparent as water. All must concede to him not only
