JAMES RussELL LOWELL.

HEBE.

SAW the twinkle of white feet,
Ι saw the flash of robes deseending;

Before her ran an influence fleet,

I sprang the proffered life to alasp-
The beaker fell; the luck was over.

That bowed my heart like barley bending. The earth has drunk the vintage up ;

As, in bare fields, the searehing bees
Pilot to blooms beyond our finding,

It led me on—by sweet degrees,
Joy’s simple honey-cells unbinding.

Those graees were that seem ed grim sates;
With nearer love the sky leaned o’er me;
The long-sought seeret's golden gates
On musical hinges swung before me.

1 saw the brimmed bowl in 1161· grasp
Thrilling with godhood ; like a lover,

that boots it pateh the goblet’s splinters?
Can summer fill the icy cup
Whose treacherous crystal is but winter's?

O spendthrift haste! await the gods;
Their nectar erowns the lips of patience.
Haste scatters on unthankful sods
The immortal gift in vain libatione.

Coy Hebe flies from those that woo,

And shuns the hands would seize upon her
Follow thy life, and she will sue

To pour for thee the cup of honor.

 

WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.
FRoM “THE BIGLOW PAPERs.²’

UVENER B. is a sensible man ;

He stays to his home an' looks arter

his folks ·
He draws his furrer ez straight ez he ean,

An’ into nobody’s tater-pateh pokes3—
But John P.

Robinson he
Sez 116 wunt vote fer Guvener B.

My! ain’t it terrible? Wut shall we du?
We ean't never ehoose him o’ course,—

Guess we shall hev to come round, (don't

An' go in fer thunder an' guns, an’ all that;
Fer John P.
Robinson he
Sez he wunt vote fer Guvener B.

Gineral C. is a dreffle smart man:

He's ben on all sides thet give places or pelf;
But consistency still wuz a part of his plan,—

He's ben true to one party‚—an' thet is

himself ;—
⁷ So John P.
Robinson he
Sez he shall vote fer Gineral C.

With good old idees o’ wut's right an' wut
ain’t‚ [pillage,
We kind o' thought Christ went agiu war an'
An’ thet eppyletts worn’t the best mark of .
But John P. [a saint ;

The side of our country must ollers be took, „

An’ President Polk, you know, he is our ”Ϊ
country ;

Puts the debit to him, an’ to us the per contry,· ἦ)
