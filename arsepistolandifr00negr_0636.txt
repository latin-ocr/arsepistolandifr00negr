“ What dost say to that?'' said Mr. Poyser‚

his wife.

attention had not at this moment been called
to the other end of the table.

 

GODFREY AND DUNSTAN.

oME one opened the door at the other

S end of the roem, and Nancy felt that it

was her husband. She turned from

the window with gladness in her eyes, for the
wife's chief dread was stilled.

‘⁴ Dear, I’m 50 thankful you're come‚'' she
said, going towards him. ‘⁴ Ι began to get ''—

8116 pansed abruptly, for Godfrey was lay-
ing down his hat with trembling hands, and
turned towards her with a pale face and a
strange, unanswering glauce, as if he saw her
indeed, but saw her as part of a scene invisi-
ble to herself. She laid her hand 011 1115 arm,
not daring to speak again; bnt he left the
touch unnoticed, and threw himself into his
chair.

Jane was already at the door 1111111 1116 1115-

said Godfrey3 and 11111611 1116 door was closed
again hc exerted himself to speak more dis-
tinetly.

“ 811 down, Nancy—there,'’ he said. point-
ing 10 a chair opposite him. “I came back
as soon as Ι could to hinder anybody’s tell-
ing you but 1116. Ι’ν6 bada great 511061(-
11111 Ι care most about the shoek it’ll be 10

“ It isn’t father and Priscilla? ” said Nancy,
with quivering lips, clasping her hands to-
gether tightly on her lap.

“ No, it's nobody living, said Godfrey, un-
equal to the considerate skill with which he
would have wished to make his revelation.
“ It's Dunstan—my brother Dunstan, that we
lost sight of sixteen years ago. We’ve found
him‚—found his body—his skeleton.''

 

The deep dread Godfrey's look had created
in N ancy made her feel these words a relief.
8116 sat in comparative calmness to hear what
else 116 had to tell. He went on:

“The stone pit has gone dry suddenly,—
from the draining, I suppose; aud there he
lies—has lain for sixteen yearS‚ wedged be-
tween two great stones. There’s his wateh
and seals, and there's my gold-handled hunt-
ing whip, with my name 011. Η6 1001( it
away, without my knowing, the day he went
hunting on Wildfire, the last time he was
seen,'’

Godfrey paused! it was not so easy to say
what came next. “ Do you think he drowned
himself? '' said N ancy, almost wondering
that her husband should be so deeply shaken
by what had happened all those years ago to
an unloved brother, of whom worse things
had been augured.

“ No, he fell in‚'’ said Godfrey, in a low but
distinct voice, as if he felt some deep mean-
ing in the fact. Presently he added: ‘⁴ Dun-
stan was the man that robbed Silas Marner.'’

The blood rushed to Nancy's face and neck
at this surprise and shame, for she had been
bred up to regard even a distant kinship with
crime as a dishonor.

“O Godfrey!” she said, with compassion
in her tone, for she had immediately reflected
that the dishonor must be felt more keenly by
her husband.

“There was money in the pit‚” he con-
tinued, “ all the weaver’s money. Every-
thing's been gathered up, and they have taken
the skeleton to the Rainbow.
