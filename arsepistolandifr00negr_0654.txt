Forever shattered and the same forever?

Who gave you your invulnerable life,

Your strength, your speed, your fury, and
your joy,

Unceasing thunder and eternal foam‘?

And who commanded (and the silence came),

Here let the billows stiffen, and have rest?

Ye icc-falls! ye that from the mountain’s

brow
Adown enormous ravines slope amabi,—

T orrents, methinks, that heard a mighty voice,
And stopped at once amid their maddest plunge l
Motionless torrents! silent cataracts!

who made you glorious as the gates of Heaven
Beneath the keen full moon ⁴? Who bade the sun
Clothe you with rainbows? Who, with living

flowers

Of loveliest blue, spread garlands at your feet?
God !—-let the toi-rents, like a shout of nations,

Answer! and let the ice-plains echo, God!

God! sing, ye meadow-streams‚ with gladsome
· 1

Ye pinffgssgsseg with your soft and soul-like

s!
And chZUildi) have a voice, yon piles of snow,

SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.

And in their perilous fall shall thunder, God!
Ye living flowers that skirt the eternal frost!
Ye wild goats sporting round the eagle’s nest!
Ye eagles‚ playmates of the mountain-storml
Ye lightnings, the dread arrows of the clouds!

Ye signs and wonders of the elements!
Utter forth God, and fill the hills with praise!

Thou, too, hoar Mount! with thy sky-point-

ing peaks,

Ost from whose feet the avalanche, unheard,

Shoots downward, glittering through the pure
serene,

Into the depth of clouds that veil thy meast,—

Thou too again, stupendous Mountain! thou

That as I raise my head, awhile bowed low

In adoration, upward from thy base

Slow travelling with dim eyes suffused with
tears,

Solemnly seemest, like a vapory cloud,

To rise before me,—Rise, O, ever rise!

Rise like a cloud of incense, from the Earth!

Thou kingly Spirit throned among the hius,

Thou dread ambassador from Earth to Heaven,

Great Hierarch! tell thou the silent sky,

And tell the stars, and tell yon rising sun,

Earth, with her thousand voices, praises God.

 

THE QUARREL OF FRIENDS.
FROM “CHRISTABEL.”

LAS! they had been friends in youth z
But whispering tongues can poison
truth ;

And constancy lives in realms above3

And life is thorny3 and youth is vain ;
And to be wroth with one we love

Doth work like maduess in the brain.
And thus it chanced‚ as I divine,
With Roland and Sir Leoline !
Each spoke words of high disdain

Ι And insult to his heart's best brother;
They parted,—ne’er to meet again !
But never either found another
To free the hollow heart from paining.
They stood aloof, the scars remaining,
Like cliffs which had been rent asunder;
A dreary sea now floats between,
But neither heat, nor frost, nor thunder
Shall wholly do away, I ween,
The marks of that which once hath been.
