SIR WALTER SCOTT. 529

Then the grim boar's head frowned on high,

Orested with bays and rosemary.

Well can the green-garbed ran ger tell
How, when, and where the monster fell :
What dogs before his death he tore,
And all the baiting of the boar.

The wassail round, in good brown bowls‚
Garnished with ribbons‚ blithely trowls,
There the huge sirloin reeked : hard by
Plum-porridge stood, and Christmas pie,
Nor failed old Scotland to produce

At such high tide, her savory goose.

Then came the merry maskers in ;
And carols roared with blithesome din,

 

If unmelodious was the song,

It was a hearty note, and strong.

Who lists may in their mumming see

Traces of ancient 1111731611Υ :

White skirts supplied the masquerade,

And smutted cheeks the visors made ;

But, oh ! what maskers, riehly dight‚

Can boast of bosoms half so light?

England was merry England, when

Old Christmas brought his sports again.

’Twas Christmas broached the mightiest
ale 1

'Twas Christmas told the merriest tale ;

A Christmas gambol oft could cheer

The poor man's heart through half the year.

SUNSET AT NORHAM GASTLE.

AY set on Norham's eastled steep,

And Tweed's fair river broad and deep,

And Cheviot's mountains lone;
The battled towers, the donjon keep,
The loop-hole grates where captives weep,
The flanking walls that round it sweep,
In yellow lustre shone.

The warriors on the turrets high,

Moving athwart the evenin g sky,
Seemed forms of giant height3

Their armor, as it caught the rays,

Flashed back again the western blaze
In lines of dazzling light.

St George's banner, broad and gay,
Now faded, as the fading ray

Less bright, and less, was flung;
The evening gale had scarce the power
To wave it 011 the donjon tower‚

So heavily it hung.

The scouts had parted on their search,
The castle gates were barred 3

 

³ Above the gloomy portal arch,

Timing his footsteps to 6 march.
The warden kept his guard,

Low humming, as he paced along,

Some ancient berder-gathering song.

A distant tramping sounds he hears3

He looks abroad, and soon appears,

O’er Horncliff hill, a plump of spears
Beneath a pennon gay:

A horseman, dar ting from the crowd,

Like lightnihg frome a summer cloud,

Spurs on his mettled courser proud,
Before the dark alray.

Beneath the sa ble palisade,

That closed the castle barricade,
His bugle-horn 116 blew ;

The warder hasted from the wall,

And warned the captain in the hall,
For well the blast he knew;

And joyfully that knight did 6611

To sewer, squire, and seneschal.
