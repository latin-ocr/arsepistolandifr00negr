RING OUT, WILD BELLS.

Βίης out the want, the care, the sin,

The faithless coldness of the times;

Βίης out, ring out my mournful rhymes,
But ring the fuller minstrel in.

ING out, wild bells, to the wild sky,
The flying cloud, the frosty light;
The year is dying ίη the night;

Βίης out, wil‹l hvlls, and let him die.

Ring ont false pride in place and blood,
Tho civio slander and the spite:

Βίης ont the old, ring ίη tha¹ new—
Βίης, happy hells. across the snow:
Βίης in the love of truth and right,

Βίης ίη the common love of good.

The year is ςηίης, let him go;
Βίης ont the false, ring in the true.

Βίης ont the grief that sads the mind,
For those that here we see no more;
Βίης out the feud of rich aud poor,

Βίης ίη redress to all mankind.

Βίης out old shapes of foul disease‚
Βίης out the narrowing lust of gold3
Βίης out the thousand wars of old,

Βίης ίη the thousand years of peace.

Ring ont a slowly dying cause,
And ancient forins of party strife;
Βίης ίη the nomer modes of life,
With sweetex· manners, purer laws.

Βίης in the valiant man and free,
The lai-ger heart, the kindlier hand ;
Βίης ont the darkness of the land—-
Βίης ίη the Christ that is to be.

GOME INTO THE GARDEN, MAUD.
C()ME into the gnrdeu, Mami-—

For the lilaek bat, night, hus flown!
Come into the gardei), Mmul,
Ι ain here at the gnte al‹›ue;
And the woodbine spiees are wufted abroad,
And the musk of the roses blown.

All night has the casement jessamine stit-red
To the daucers ‹lancing in tune—-

Till a silence fell with the waking bird,
And a hnsh with the setting moon.

I said to the lily, “ There is but one
With whom she has heart to be gay.
For a breeze of morning ulmea, WVhen will the dancers leave her alone?
And the planet of Love is on high, She is weary of dance and play.”
Reginning to faint ίη the light that she loves, Now half to the setting moon are gone,

 

On a bed of dass'odil sky,
To faint ίη the light of the sun she loves,
'l'o faint in his light, und to die.

All night have the roses heard
The flute, violin, bassoon:

And half to the rising day3

Low οη the saud and lond ou the ‘etone

The lust wheel echoes away.

I said to the rose, “ The brief ni-,jht goes

In babble and revel and wine 3
