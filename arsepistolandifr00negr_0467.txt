FAVORITE POEMS AND PROSE SELECTIONS. 419

Rest on, embalmed and sainted dead! Yon marble minstrel's voiceless stone

’ Dear as the blood ye gave; In deathless song shall tell,

No impious foot-step here shall tread then many a vanished year hath flown,
The herbage of your grave! The story how ye fell;

Nor shall your glory be fcrgot Nor wreck, nor change, nor winter's blight,
While Fame her record keeps, Nor time’s remorseless doom,

Or Honor points the hallowed spot Can dim one ray of holy light
Where Valor proudly sleeps. l That gilds your glorious tomb.

LAST HYMN.

BY PHILIP PAUL BLISS.

Evangelist and hymn writer, born at Clearfield,Pennsylvania‚1838; killed at As hta·
bula, Ohio, in a railway accident, December 29,1876.

KNOW not what awaits me, And sweetly through the silence came
God kindly veils mine eyes, His loving “ Follow Me.''
And o’er each step on my onward way
He makes new soenes arise; O blissful lael< of wisd0m‚
And every ,1οΥ He sends me comes ’Tis blessed not to know ;
A sweet and glad SUl‘prise. He holds me with His own right hand,

And will not let me go,
And lulls my troubled soul to rest,
In Him who loves me so,

CHORUs
XVhere He may lead I’ll follow,
My trust in Him repose,
And every hour in perfect peace

I'll sing, “ He knows, He knows.'' SOIOUV Ῐ 133), Πῗῐξῗῡῑνξῖἰέἰ.
One step I see before me; I'd naaliel· xlxlglkl in tlhleodlark with God
'Tis all I need to see3 Than go alone in the light ;
The light of heaven more brightly shines I’d rather wall< by faith with Him
‘Vhen earth’s illusions flee, l T han go alone by sight,
THE RAIL.
Δ ΒΥ GEORGE H. CLARK.
MET him in the cars, So, launching into talk,
Where resignedly he sat; We rattled on our way,
His hair was full of dust, With allusions to the crops
And so was his cravat3 That along the meadows lay,—
He was furthermore embellished thereupon his eyes were lit
By a ticket in his hat. With a speculative ray.
The conductor touched his arm, The heads of many men
And awoke him from a nap; WVere bobbing as in sleep‚
WVhen he gave the feeding flies And many babies lifted
An admonitory slap‚ Their voices up to weep ;
And his ticket to the man While the coal-dust darkly fell

In the yellow-lettered cap. On bonnets in a heap.
