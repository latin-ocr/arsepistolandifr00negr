⁷ f ” ΝΕ of the most honorable literary careers, and witha] profitable,
l is that of Mr. Aldrich, who is very widely and favorably known

ἴ . as a writer of both prose and verse. It is sufficient to say that
*J* for a number of years he was editor of the “Atlantic Monthly.''
and only resigned the position for the purpose of travelling
and allowing himself a period of leisure and of literary work
somewhat different from that of editor.

Mr. Aldrich has been an industrious author and has secured a wide
circle of readers who fully appreciate his artistic skin‚ which appears iu
all his productions. Never writing merely to order, never writing to
gratify a fleeting fancy, but always with a high aim in view and with an
earnest endeavor to put forth the best product of his pen, he has been
invariably successful and has written few lines “ which dying, he would
wish to blot.”

He was born at Portsmouth‚ New Hampshire‚ in 18 36. All through
his early life he contributed verses to different publications‚ and these
were gathered in. 1876, with newer matter, into one volume under the
name of “ Cloth of Gold.‘’ Later volumes of verse were “ Flower and
Thorn,'' which appeared in 1876; and “ Mercedes‚'‘ issued in 1883.

Mr. Aldrich is also a prose author and has published several volumes,
all of which are stamped with the characteristics of his own superior
talent. Among these works are “The Story of a Bad Boy‚'' issued in
1869; “Prudence Palfrey‚'' 18743 “The Queen of Sheba,'' 18773 “The
Still Water Tragedy‚'' 1880; and “ From Ponkapog to Pesth,‘' which
was given to the public in 1882. Among his later poems is “Judith and
Holofernes,'’ which was published in 1896. Among the later prose works
are “An Old Town by the Sea‚'’ and “Two Bites at a Cherry and Other
Tales‚'’ published in 1893 3 and “ Unguarded Gates‚” in 1895. Mr. Ald-
rich's complete works in eight volumes were published in 1897.
