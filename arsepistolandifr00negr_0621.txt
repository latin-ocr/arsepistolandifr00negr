RUDYARD KIPLING.

Far-called our navies melt away ;

On dune and headland sinks the fire 3
Lo, all our pomp of yesterday

Is one with Nineveh aud Tyrel
J udge of the nations, spare us yet, “
Lest we forget-—lest we forget l

If, drunk with sight of power, we loose
Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe——
such boasting as the Gentiles use

573

Or lesse-r breeds without the law—
Lord God of hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget——lest we forget 1

For heathen heart that puts her trust

In reeking tube and iron shard—
All valiant (lust that builds on dust,

And guarding calls not Free to guard-
For frantie boast and foolish word,

Thy rnercy in Thy people, Lord l

 

THE FUTURE.

HEN Earth’s last picture is painted,
W and the tubes are twisted and dried.
When the oldest colors have faded,
and the youn gest critic has died,
We shall rest, and, faith, we shall need it—
lie down for an aeon or two,

Till the Master of all Grood NVorkmen shall

set us to work anew.

And those that were good shall be happy;
they shall sit in a golden ehair;

They shall splash at a ten-league canvas with
brushes of eomets’ hair;

They shall find real saints to draw from-—
Magdalene, Peter and Paul ;

They shall work for an age at a sitting and
never be tired at all l

And only the Master shall praise us, and only
the Master shall blame!

And no one shall work for money, and no one
shall work for fame ;

But each for the joy of the working, and
each, in his separate star,

Shall draw the Thing as he sees it for the God

of Things as They Are!

 

THE ISLANDERS.

E vaunted your fathoxnless power and ye
flaunted your iron pride

Ere ye fawned on the younger Nations
for the men who could shoot and ride 1

Then ye returned to your idols; then ye con-
tented your souls

With the flannelled fools at the wicket or the
muddled oafs at the goals. [lie.

Given to strong delusion, wholly believing a

Ye saw that the land lay ’feneeless and ye let
the months go by

Waiting some easy wonder, hoping some saving
Sign—

Idle—-openly idle—in the lee of the forespent
Line.

Idle—except for your boasting, and what is
your boasting worth

If ye grudge a year of service to the lordliest
life on Earth?

Aneient, effortless, ordered, eycle on cyele
set—

Life so long untroubled that ye who inherit

It was not made with the mountains, it is not
one with the deep.

Men, not gods devised it.
must keep.

Men, not gods

Arid, aloof, incurious, unthinking, unthank-
ing, golt—-

Will ye loose your sehools to flout them till
the browbeat columns melt'?

Will ye pray them or preach then] or print

them or ballot them back from your shore ⁶?

Will your workmen issue a mandate to bid
them strike no more?

Will ye rise and dethrone your rulers? (Be-
cause ye were idle both.
