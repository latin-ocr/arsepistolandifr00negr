JOHN MILTON.

Eyeless in Gaza, at the mill with slaves,
Himself in bonds under Philistian yoke Ι

O loss of sight, of thee Ι 111031 complain!

Blind among enemies, O, worse than chains,

Dungeon, or beggary, or decrepit age!

Light, the prime work of God, to me is extinct,

And all her various objects of delight

Annulled‚ which might in part my grief have
eased,

Inferior to the vilest now become

563

Of man or worm ; 1110 vilest here excel me:
They creep, yet see ; Ι dark in light exposed
To daily fraud, contempt, abuse, and wrong,
Within doors or without, still as a fool,

In power of others, never in my own;

Scarce half Ι seem to live, dead more than

O darkllssgllgrk, dark, amid the blaze of noon,
Irrecoverably dark, total eclipse,

Without all hope of day!

 

ADAM DESCRIBING EVE.

INE eyes he closed, but open left the cell, Mean, or in her summed up, in her contained

Of fancy, my internal sight, by which

And in her looks, which from that time infused

Abstract‚ as in a trance, methought I Sweetness into my beart, unfelt before,

Though 310οῙῗ111ἒ, where I lay, and saw the
811118ἑ1ἶξίῗη13 before whom awake Ι stood;
Wh0, stooping, opened my left side, and took
From thence a rib, with cordial spirits warm,
And life-blood streaming fresh ; wide was the
But giicfililtei'ly with flesh filled up and healed ;
The rib he formed and fashioned with his
Undciiidhiissf'brn1i11g hands a creature grew,
Manlike, but different sex, so lovely fair,
That what seemed fair 111 all the world seemed
now

And into all things from her air inspired
The spirit of love and amorous delight.

She disappeared‚ and left me dax-k ; Ι waked
To find her, or forever to deplore

Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure:
WVhen out of hope, behold her, not far off,
Such as Ι saw her in my dream, adorned
With what all earth or Heaven could bestow
To make her amiable. On she came,

Led by her heavenly Maker, though unseen,
And guided by his voice, nor uninformed

Of nu ptial sanctity and marriage rite-s:
Grace was in all her steps, Heaven in her eye,
In every gesture dignity aud love.

 

FROM THE HYMN TO THE NATIVITY.

T was the winter wild,
While the heaven-born child
All meanly wrapt in the rude manger
lies ;

Nature, in awe to him,
Had doffed her gaudy trim,

With her great Master so to sympathize ;

It was no season then for her
v'To wauton with the sun, her lusty paramour

No war or battle’s sound
Was heard the world around,

The hooked chariot stood
Unstaiued with hostile blood;
The trumpet spake not to the armed throng;
And kings sat still with awful eye,
Asis they surely knew their sovereign Lord
was by.

But peaceful was the night,

XVherein the Prince of Light

His reign of peace upon the earth began:
The winds, with wonder whist,

The idle spear and shield were high up Smoothly the waters kist,

hung3

Whispering new joys to the mild ocean,
