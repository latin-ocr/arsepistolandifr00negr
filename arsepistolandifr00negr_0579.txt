SIR WALTER SCOTT.

Come as the winds come when
Forests are rended ;

Come 03 1110 waves come when
Navies are stranded ;

Faster come, faster come,
Faster and faster,

Ohief, vassal, page and groom,
Tenant and master.

531

Fast they come, fast they come3
See how they gather!

Wide wave the eagle plume
Blended with heather.

Cast your plaids, draw your blades,
Forward each man set!

Pibroch of Donuil Dhu,
Knell for the onset!

MARMION AND DOUGLAS.

OW far aclvanced was morning day,
Ν ΧΥ11011 Μο11111011 did his troop array
To Surrey’s camp to ride;
He had safe conduct for his band,
Beneath the royal 3001 and hand,
And Douglas gave a guide :
The ancient Earl, with stately grace,
Would Clara on her palfrey place,
And whisper in an undertone,
“ Let the hawk stoop, his prey is fiown.’'—
The train from out the castle drew,
But Marmion stopped to bid adieu :-
“ Though something I might ’1110111,” 110 301(1,
“Of cold respect to stranger guest,
Sent hither by your King’s behest,
While in Tantallon's towers Ι stayed ;
Part we in friendship from your land,
And, noble Earl, receive my ha11d.”—
But Douglas round him drew his cloak‚
Folded his arms, and thus he spoke :
“ My mauors, halls, and bowers, shall still
Be open, at my Sovereign’s will,
To each one whom he lists, howe'er
Unmeet to be the owner's peer.
My castles are my King's alone,
From turret to foundation stone—-
The hand of Douglas 13 1113 own ;
And never shall in friendly grasp
The hand of such as Marmion clasp.''

Burned Marmion’s swarthy cheek like fire,
And shook his very frame for ire,
And—“ This to me 1 ” he said,
“ An 'twere not for thy hoary beard,
Such hand as Marmion's had not spared
To cleave the Douglas’ head!
And, first, I tell thee, haughty Peer,
He, who does England's message here,
Although the meanest in her state,
May well, proud Augus, be thy 11101οε

And, Douglas‚ more Ι tell 11100 11010,
Even in thy 1111011 of pride,

Here in thy hold, thy vassels near,

(Nay, never look upon your lord,

And lay your hands upon your swonl),
Ι tell thee, thou'rt defied !

And if thou said'st I am not peer

To any lord in scotland here,

Lowland or Highland, far or near,
Lord Augus, thou has lied 1 ''

On the Earl’s cheek the flush of rage
O’ercame the ashen hue of age:
Fierce he broke forth—“ And darest thou 111011
To beard the lion in his den,
The Douglas 111 1113 hall?
And hopest thou thence 1111300111οᾹ 10 go ⁶?—
No, by St. Eride of Bothwell, no!
Up dlawbridge, grooms—what, &Vax-der, ho!
Let the portcullis fall.’'—

The steed along the draw-bridge flies,
Just as it trembled on the 1130;
Α11(1 when Lord Marmion reached his hand,
He 110113, 011(1 turns with 01011011οᾱ hand,
And shout of loud defiance pours,
1 And shook his gauntlet at the towers.
³ “ Horsel horse Ι ” 1110 Douglas cried, ⁶· and
Ι 0110301 ”
But soon he reigned his fury's 11000 :
“ A royal messenger he 001110,
Though most unworthy of the name.—

“ Saint Mary mend my fiery mood 1
Old age ne‘er 00013 1110 Douglas' blood,
Ι thought to slay him where he stood.
’Tis pity οῖ’ 111111 100,” 110 011οᾶ ;

“ Bold he can speak, and fairly ride,

Ι 1170110111 111111 0 warrior 1110(1.”

With this, his mandate he 1000113,

And slowly seeks his castle walls.
