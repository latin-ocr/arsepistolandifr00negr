and another potato. When we had done, 116
brought 1116 3 pudding, and having set it before
me, seemed to ruminate, and to become absent
in his mind for some moments. “ How's the
pie ἶ) ” 116 331(1, rousing himself.

‘⁴ It's pudding,’' Ι made answer.

“Pudding!'' he exclaimed. “Why bless
ine, so it is! What !'’ looking at it nearer.
“ You don’t mean to say it’s abatte1·-pudding‘?’'

‘¹ Yes, it is indeed.''

“thy‚ a batter pudding,” he said, taking
up a tablespoon, “is my favorite padding!
Ain't that lucky‘? Come on, little 'un‚ and
let's see who'll get most.”

The waiter certainly got most. He en-
treated me niore than once to come in and
win, but what with his tablcspoon to my tea-
spoon, his dispatch to my dispatch‚ and his
appetite to my appetite, Ι was left far behind
at the first mouthful, and had no chance with
him. Ι never saw anyone enjoy a pudding so
much, Ι think; and he laughed, when it was
all gone, as if his enjoyment of it lasted still.

Finding him so very friendly and coni-
panionable, it was then that I asked for the
11611 and ink and paper, to write to Peggotty.
He not only brought it immediately, but was
good enough to look over me while Ι wrote
the letter. When I had finished it, he asked
me where I was going to school.

Ι said, “Near London‚'’ which was all I

knew.

“ Oh, my eye! '’ he said, looking very low-
spirited‚ “ I am sorry for that.’'

“ Why ἶ) ” Ι asked him.

‘⁶ Oh ! '’ he said, shaking his head, “ that's
the school where they broke the boy’s 11113ἡ

two ribs—a little boy he was. Ι should say ³

he was—let me see—how old are you, about? ''
I told him between eight and 111116.
“Τ1131’3 just his age,’' 116 said. “He was
eight years and six months old when they
broke his first rib; eight years and eight
months old when they broke his second, and
did for him.”
, Ι could not disguise from myself, or from
the waiter, that this was an uncomfortable
coincidence, and inquired how it was done.
His answer was not cheering to my spirits,
for it consisted of two dismal words, “ With
whopping.’' ¹ ‘⁷

The blowing of the coach-horn in the yard
was a seasonable diversion, which made 1116 get
up and hesitatingly inquire, 111 1116 niingled
pride and diffidence of having a pnrse (which
Ι took out of my pocket), if there were any·
thing to pay.

“ There’s a sheet of letter-paper,'' 116 16-
turned. “ Did you ever buy a 311661 of letter-
paper?'’

Ι could not remember that Ι ever had.

“Its dear‚'’ he said, “on account of 1116
duty. Threepence. That’s the way we’re
taxed in this country. There’s nothing else,
except the waiter. Never mind the ink. Ι
1036 by that.'’

“What should you—what should I——how
much ought Ι to—what would it be right to
pay the waiter‚ if you please ⁸? '’ Ι stammered,
b'ushing.

“If Ι hadu't a family, and that family
hadn't the cowpock,'' said the 1131161, “Ι
wouldn’t take a sixpence. If Ι (11(111’1 31111-
port a aged pairint and a lovely sister ''——here
the waiter was greatly agitated-“ Ι wouldn’t
take a farthing. If I had a good place, and
was treated well here, Ishould beg acceptance
of a tris-le, instead of taking of it. But Ι live
on broken wittles, and I sleep 011 the eoals”
—here the waiter burst into tears.

Ι was very much concerned for his missor-
tunes, and felt that any recognition short of
ninepence would be mere brutality and hard-
ness of heart. Therefore I gave him one of
my three bright shillings, which he received
with much humility and veneration, and spnn
up with his thumb, directly afterwards, to try
the goodness of.

It was a little disconcerting to me to find,
when Ι was being helped up behind the coach,
that Ι was supposed to have eaten all the
dinner without any assistance. Ι discovered
this· from overhearing the lady in the bow-
window say to the guard, “ 'sake care of that
child, George, or he’ll burst!⁷' and from
observing that the women servants who were
about the place came out to look and giggle
at 1116 33 3 young phenomenon. My unfortu-
nate friend the waiter‚ who had quite re—
covered his spirits, did not appear to be dis-
turbed by this, but joined in the general
