I perceivcd his sisters mighty busy in fitting
out Moses for the fair; trimming his hair,
brushing his buckles, 111111 cocking his hat with
pins. 'l'hc business of the toilet being over,

111011111011 1111011 1110 0011, with a deal box before

a coat 01’ that eloth called thuuder and light-

too good to be thrown away. His waistcoat
was of gosling green, and 1115 5151015 had tied
his hair 111111 11 broad black ribbon. We all
followed him several paces from the door,
bawling after him, “ Good luck 1 good luck 1 ”
1111 wc could 510 him no longer.

He had scarcely gone when Mr. Thornhill's
butler came to congratulate 115 1111011 0111· good
fortune, saying that he had overheard his
young master mention our names with great
0011111101111311011.

Good fortune seemed resolved not to come
alone. Another sootman from the same family
followed, with a card for my daughters, import-
ing that the two ladies had received such pleas-
ing accounts from Mr. Thornhill of us all,
that, after a few previous inquiries, they hoped
to bc perfectly satisficd.

‘⁶ Ay,” cried my wife, “I now 500 11 15 110
easy matter to get into one of the families of
1111» gr‹·at; but when once one gets in, then, as
Moses says, one may go to sleep.''

To this piece of humor, for she intended it
sor wit, my daughters assented with a loud
laugh of 11103511 10. Ι11 short, such was her
satisfaction at this message, that she actually
put 1101· hand in her pocket, and gave the
messengcr sevcnpence halfpenny.

This was to 110 our visiting day. The next
that came was Mr. Burchell, who had been at
the fair. He brought my little ones a penny-
worth of gingerbrcad each, which my wife
undertook to keep for them, and give them
by little at a time. He brought my daughters
also a couple of boxes, in which they might
keep wasers, snuff, patches, or even money,
when they got it. My wife was unusually
fond of a weasel-skin purse, as being the most
lucky; but this by-thc-byc. We had still a
regard for Mr. Burchell, though his late rude

behaviour was in some measure displeasing·,
nor could we now avoid communicating our
happiness to him, and asking his advice;
although we seldom follow advice, we were all
ready enough to ask it. When he read the

note from the two ladies he shook his head,
and observed that an affair of this sort de-

manded the utmost circumspection. This air
of diffidence highly displeased my wife.

‘⁴ Ι never doubted, sir‚’' cried she, “ your
readiness to be against my daughters and me.
You have more circumspection than is wanted.
However, Ι fancy when we come to ask advice

we shall apply to persons who have made use
of it themselves.'’

“Whatever my own conduct may have
been, madam‚’' replied he, “is not the pres-
ent question3 though as I have made no use
of advice myself, I should in conscience give
it to those that will.''

As Ι was apprehensive this answer might
draw on a repartee, making up by abuse what
is wanted in wit, I changed the subject by
seeming to wonder what could keep our 5011
50 long at the fair, 35 11 was now almost
nightfall.

“Never mind our son‚'’ cried my wife3
“depend on it he knows what he is about.
I'll warrant we'll never see him 5011 1115 hen
on a rainy (lay. I have seen him buy such
bargains as would amaze you. I’ll tell you a
good story about that, that will make you

box at his back.''

As she spoke, Moses came slowly on foot,
and sweating under the deal box, which he
had strapped round his shoulders like a pedlar.

“ WVelcome! welcome, Moses! Well, my
boy, what have you brought us from the fair? ’'

“ I have brought you myself‚'' cried Moses,
with a sly look, and resting the box on the
dresser.

“Ah‚ Moses‚'⁵ cried my wife, “that we know ;
but where is the horse? '’

“I have sold him‚’' cried Moses, “for three
pounds five shillings and two pence.''

“Well done, my good boy‚’' returned she;
“ Ι knew you would touch them off. Between
ourselves, three pounds five shillings and two-
