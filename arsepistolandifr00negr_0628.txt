TO NIGHT.
WIFTLY walk over the western wave, Wrap thy form in a mantle gray,
S spirit of Night! Stat-inwroughtl
Out of the misty eastern cave, Blind with thine hair the eyes of day,
NVhere‚ all the long and lone daylight‚ Kiss her until she be wearied out;
T hou wovest dreams of joy and sear, Then wander o’er city, and sea, and land,
Which make thee terrible and dear‚— Touching all with thine opiate wand—

Swift be thy ssight! Come, long-sought!
