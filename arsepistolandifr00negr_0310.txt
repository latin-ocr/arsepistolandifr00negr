262 JOAQUIN MILLER.

Hung 1161· horn in the palms, when surely aud
soon

And swift she would join me and all would be 1

well

Without bloodshed or word. And now as she
Fronieilie front, and went down in the ocean

The liisihtliat Ι saw was a look of delight
That I should escape-a love—a desire—
Yet never a word, not a look of appeal—
Lest I should reaeh hand, should stay hand or
One biiiislyaiitefl'or· her in my terrible ssight.

Then the rushing of fire rose around me and
:nd r,

Andltheehowling of beasts like the sound of
thunder—

 

Beasts burning and blind and forced onward
and over,

As the passionate flame reached around them
and wove her ·

Hands in their hair, and kissed hot till they

Till (1116151 died with a wild and a desolate

As 522} beart-broken on the hard brown

All(l»itl?t¹:)e‚the Brazos I rode all alone-—

All alone, save only a horse long-limbed,

And blind and bare and burnt to the skin.

Then, just as the terrible sea came in

,And tumbled its thousands hot into the

tide,

1 Till the tide blocked up and the· swift stream

brimmed
In eddies, we struck on the opposite side.

THE FORTUNATE ISLES.

OU sai] and you seek for the Fortunate
15165,
The old Greek Isles of the yellow bird’s
song?
Then steer straight on through the watery
1111165,
Straight on, straight on, and you ean’t go
wrong.
Nay, not to the left, nay, not the right,
But on, straight on, and the 15165 are in sight,
The Fortunate Isles where the yellow birds
sing,
And life lies girt with a golden ring.

These Fortunate Isles they are not 50 far,
They lie within reaeh of the lowli‹st door;
You ean 566 them glenm bv the twilight star;
You ean hear them sing by the moon's white

shore.

Nay, never look back 1 Those leveled grave-
stones,
They were landing-steps; they were steps unto
thrones
Of glory for souls that have sailed before,
And have set white feet on the fortunate
shore.

And what are the names of the Fortunate
5 ¹?

Wssjlresdmy and love and a large content.
Lo! these are the Isles of the watery miles

That God let down from the firmament;
Lo! duty and love, and a true man's trust;
Your forehead to God, and your feet in the
Lo! (hiliishhd love, and sweet babe's smiles,
And these, O friend, are the Fortunate Isles.
