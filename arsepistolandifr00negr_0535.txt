ROBERT BROWNING.

But do not detain me now, for she lingers
There, like sunshine over the ground ;

And ever Ι see her soft white fingers
Searching after the bud she found.

Flower‚ you Spaniard! look that you grow
not,
Stay as you are and be love forever.
Bud, if Ι kiss you, 'tis that you blow not—
Mind! the shut pink mouth opens never!
For while thus it pouts, her fingere wrestle,
Twinkling the audacious leaves between,

487

Till round they turn, and down they nestle:

Is not the dear mark still to be seen?

When Ι find her not, beauties vanish;

Whither Ι follow her, beauties flee.

Is there no method to tell her in Spanish

June's twice June since she breathed it with
me ?

Come, birds, show me the least of her traces. i

Treasure my lady's lightest footfall ε
Ah! you may flout and turn up your faces——
Roses, you are not so fair after all!

 

THE LOST LEADER.

UST for a handful of silvei· he left us;
Just for a ribbon to stick in his coat—
Found the one gift of which fortune be-
Lost all therg{{]glr3g she lets us devote.

They, with the gold to give, doled him out ,

silver,
So much was theirs who so little allowed :
How all our copper had gone for his ser-
vice!
Rags—were they purple, his heart had been
proudl
We that had loved him so, followed him, hon-
ored him,
Lived in his mild and magnificent eye,
Learned his great language, caught his clear
accents,
Made him our pattern to live and to diei
Shakespeare was of 115, Milton was for us,
Burns, Shelley, were with us-—they watch
from their graves!
He alone breaks from the van and the free—

men
He alone, sinks to the rear and the slaves 1

 

We shall march prospering——not through his
presence ,
Songs may inspirit us—not from his lyre :
Deeds will be done—while he boasts his quies-
cence‚ [aspire.
Still bidding crouch whom the rest bade
Blot out his name then—record one lost soul
more, [untrod 3
One task more declined, one more footpath
One more triumph for devils, and sorrow for
angele, [Godl
One wrong more to man, one more insult to
Life’s night begins ; let him never come back
to us!
There would be doubt, hesitation, and pain ;
Forced praise on our part—the glimmer of
twilight,
Never glad, confident morning again!
Best fight on well, for we taught him—strike
gallantly, [own ;
Aim at our heart, ere we pierce through his
Then let him receive the new knowledge and
wait us,
Pardoned in heaven, the first by the throne!
