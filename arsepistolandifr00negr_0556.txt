508 CH A RLES

now, and he was unwilling to ring his bell at
that hour of the night, he slipped on his coat,
of which he had just divested himself, and
taking the japanned candlestick in his hand,
walked quietly down stairs.

The more stairs Mr. Pickwick went down,
the more 313113 there seemed to be to descend,
aud again and again, when Mr. Pickwick got
into some narrow passage, and began to con-
gratulate himself on having gained the ground-
flour. d³d another flight of stairs appear before
his as·.‹·nished eyes. At last 110 reached a
stoue hall, which he remembered to have seen
when hc entered the house. Passage after pass—
age did he explore3 room after room did he
peep int0; at length, just as he was on the
point of giving up the search in despair, he
opencd the door of the identical room in which
he had spent the evening‚ and beheld his miss-
ing property on the table.

Mr. Pickwick seized the watch in triumph,
and proceeded to retraee his steps to his bed-
chamber. If his progiess downward had been
attended with difficulties 31111 uncertainty, his
jouruey back was infinitely more perplexing.
He was reduced to the verge of despair, when
an open door attracted his attention. He
peeped in—-right at last. There were the two
beds, whose situation he perfectly remembered,
and the fire still burning. His candle, not a
long one when he first received 11, had flick-
ered away in the drifts of air through which
he had passed, and sank into the socket, just
as he closed the door after him. “ No 11131101·,”
said Mr. Pickwick‚ “ I can undress myself
just as well by the light of the fire.'’

“ It is the best idea‚'’ said Mr. Pickwick to
himself, smiling till he almost cracked the
night-cap strings. “It is the best idea, my
losing myself 111 this place, and wandering
about those staircases, that I 0101· heard of.
Droll, d roll, very droll.'' Here ΜΓ. Pickwick
ς31011011 again, a broadersmile thau before, and
was about to continue the process of undress-
ing iu the best of humor, when he was sud-
denly stopped by an unexpeeted interruption :

111-1111, the entrance into the room of some
person with a candle‚ who, after locking the

door, :ulvanced to the dressing-table‚ aud set
down the light upon it.

DICKENS.

Mr. Pickwick almost fainted with horror
and dismay. Standing before the dressing-
glass was a middle-aged lady in yellow curl-
papers, busily engaged in brushing what
ladies call their “back hair.’' However the
unconscious middle-aged lady came into that ’
100111, 11 was quite clear that she contemplated
remaining there for the night; for she had
brought a rushlight and shade with 1101, which,
with praiseworthy precaution against fire, she
had stationed in a basin on the fioor, where
it was glimmering away like a gigantic light· ’
1101130, 111 a particularly small pieee of water.

“Bless my soul,'' thought Mr. Pickwick‚
“ how very dreadful 1 ''

“Hem!'' said the lady; and in went Mr. ”

Pickwick’s head with automaton-like ra-
pidity.

“ I never met with anything 30 awful 33
11113,” thought poor Mr. Pickwick‚ the cold ’

perspiration starting 111 drops upon his night· '

“ Neverl This is fearful.”

ca ›.
lIt was quite impossible to resist the urgent

desire to see what was going forward. So out ’

went Mr. Pickwick's head again. The pros-

pect was worse than before. The middle-aged ¹

lady had finished arranging her hair, and

carefully enveloped it in a muslin night-cap ⁵

with a small plaited berder, and was gazing
pensively on the fi re.

‘· This matter is growing alarming,” reasoned
Mr. Pickwick with himself. ‘⁴ 1 can't allow
things to go on in this way. By the sels-pos-
session of that lady, it is clear to me that I
must have come into the wrong room. If‘I
call out, she'll alarm the house, but if Ι 10-
main here, the consequences will be still more
frightful.'’

He shrank behind the 0111131113, 31111 called
out very loudly :

‘⁴ Ha-hum l ’'

That the lady started at this unexpected '

sound was evident‚ by her falling up against

the rusb-light shade3 that she persuaded her· .-
self it must have been the effect of her im· ‘

agination was equally clear, for when Mr.

Pickwick‚ under the impression that 1110 had >¹

fainted away stone-dead from fright, ventured

to peep out again, she was gazing pensively ’

011 the fire as before.
