108 WALT WHITMAN.

tle, and many an old soldier to this day loves and honors his memory. ζ
Ι11 1874 NVhitman took up his residence at Camden, where he resided ⁴
until his death. Partially paralyzed as he now was, he was in no small ,1
danger of falling into absolute poverty, had it not been for the timely ¹
help of his admirers beyond the Atlantic, a movement in which T enny-
5011, Cadyle, Ruskin and other leading authors took generous and active
part. Later on several wealthy American citizens honored themselves
and their country by liberally providing for the aged poet‘s simple wants.
He was never married.

Like W'ordsworth he would sing “man as man,'' only with a far
wider and bolder sweep of subject and greater daring of treatment. His .
rhythm at 1111165 15 1101 rhythm at all, and his poenis sometimes show a
strange mixture of the lofty and the commouplace, apparently adhering
to 110 111165 of poetry whatever. This may count with many as a mark¹
of genius. Doubtless it is upon certain passages and brief excerpts that
Whitmau‘s fame will rest. It may come true that as time goes on he
will receive the abundant honor which failed to fall to his lot during his

life.
