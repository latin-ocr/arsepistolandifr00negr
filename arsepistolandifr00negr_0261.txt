SOME DAY.
OME day—so many tearful eyes And blurred and streaked with drops of brine
Are watehing for the dawning light! - Upon the lips of pain!
So many faces toward the skies

So many falling prayers that reel Make stronger yet the hope that runs
And stagger upward through the storm ; Before thy coming smile.

And yearning hands that reaoh and feel

No pressure true and wal-m! And haste and find them where they wait,

Let summer winds blow down that way,
So many hearts whose erimson wine And all they long for, soon or late,
Is wasted to a purple stain ; Bring round to them—some day.
