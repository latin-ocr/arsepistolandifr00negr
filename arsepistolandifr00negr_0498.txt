Now in fancy comes my mother, Glide around my wakeful pillow

As she used to, years agone, With their praise or mild reproof,
To survey her dai-ling dreamers, As Ι listen to the murmur

Ere she left them till the dawn ; Of the soft rain on the roof.

Oh! I see 1191· bending o'er me,
As I list. to this refrain

Which is played upon the shingles
By the patter of the rain.

And another comes to thrill me
With her eyes' delicious blue,

And forgot I, gazing on her,
That her heart was all untru03

Thon my little seraph sister, I remember but to love her

With her wings and waving hair, With a rapture kin to pain ;
And her bright-eyed cherub brother, And my heart's quick pulses vibrate
A serene, angelic pair! To the patter of the rain.
