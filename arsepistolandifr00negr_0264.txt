216 JAMES KIRKE PAULDING.

Mr. Paulding's writings are distinguished for a decided nationality.

He had no respect for authority unsupported by reason, but on all sub- · ’

iects thought and judged for himself. He defended our government and
institutions‚ and embodied what is peculiar in our manners and opinions.
There is hardly a character in his works who would not in any country

be instantly recognised as an American.
Ι He is unequalled in a sort of quaint and whimsical humor, but occa· ⁴
sionally falls into the common error of thinking there is humor in ¹
epithets. Humor is a quality of feeling and action, and like any senti- ἶ
ment or habit should be treated in a style which indicates a sympathy
with it. He who pauses to invent its dress will usually find his inven-
tion exhausted before he attempts its body. He seems generally to have
no regular schemes and premeditated catastrophieS. He follows the lead y
of a free fancy and writes down whatever comes into his mind.· He
creates his characters, and permits circumstances to guide their conduct.
Mr. Paulding died at Tarrytown, April 4, 1860. His son, W. I. .
Paulding‚ published his literary life, April, 1867, and four volumes of his
select works were reprinted in New York iu 1867-68.

 

THE: QUARREL OF SQUIRE BULL AND HIS SON

FROM “JOHN BULL AND BROTHER JONA'I'HAN.’'

HE squire was as tight a hand to deal
T with in doors as out ; sometimes trcating
his family as if they were not the same
flesh and blood, when they happened to differ
with him in certain matters. One day he got
into a dispute with his youngest son ι1011111111111,
who was familiarly called Brother <Ionatham
about whether churches ought to be called
churches or meeting-houses ; and whether
steeples were not an abomination. The squire,
either having the worst of the argument, or
being naturally impatient of contradiction, (I
can’t tell whicln) fell into a great passion, and
swore he would physic such notions out of the
boy's noddle. So he went to some of his doc-
1013 and got them to draw up a prescription,
made up of thirty-nine different articles, many
of them bitter enough to some palates.
This he tried to make Jonathan swallow ;
and finding he made villainous wry faces, and

would not do it, fell upon him and beat him ·
like fury. After this, he made the house so ¹
‹lisagreeable to him, that Jonzltliali, though as
hard as a pine knot and as tough as leather, ’
could bear it no longer. Taking his gun and
his axe, he put himself in a boat and paddied
over the millpond to some new lands to which
the squire pretended some sort of claim,

intending to settle them, and build a meeting·

house without a steeple as soon as he grew
rich enough. ·

When he got over, J onathan found that the τ
land was quite in a state of nature, covered
with wood‚ and inhabited by nobody but wild
beasts. But being a lad of mettle, he took his J

axe on one shoulder and his gun on the other, ,

marched into the thickest of the wood‚ and
clearing a place, built a log hut. Pursuing ,

his labors, and handling his axe like a notable

woodman‚ he in a few years cleared the land,
