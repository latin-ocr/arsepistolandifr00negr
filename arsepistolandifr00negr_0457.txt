seek on entering a home, and the last thing
from which we reluctantly part.

The second stage 011 the downward road is
the photograph of the boy with fresh-cropped
hair, and in which the stiff and protuberant
thumb takes a leading part.

Then follows the portrait of the lad with
strongly marked freckles and a look of hope-
less melancholy. With the aid of a detective
agency I have succeeded in running down

 

and destroying several of these pictures which
were attributed to me.

Next comes the young man, 21 years of
age, with his front hair plaster-ed smoothly
down over his tender, throbbing dome of
thought. He does not care so much about
the expression on the mobile features, so long
as his left hand, with the new ring on it,
shows distinctly, and the string of jingling
charms on his watch chain, including the cute
little basket cut out of a peach stone, stand
out well in the foreground. If the young
man would stop to think for a moment that 1
501116 day he may become eminent and ashamed
of himself, he would hesit-ate about doing this,
Soon after, he has a tin—type taken, 111 which
a young lady sits in the alleged grass, while
he stands behind her with his hand lightly
touching her shoulder as though he might be
feeling of the thrilling circumference of a
buzz-saw. He carries this picture in his
pocket for months, and looks at it whenever
he may be unobserved.

He then, in a fickle moment, allows himself
to be photographed, because he is afraid 116
may not live through another long, hard

winter, and the boys would like a picture of
him while he is able to climb the dark‚ nar-
row stairs which lead to the artist's room.

Sadly the thought comes back to you in
after years, when his grave is green 111 the
quiet valley, and the worn and weary hands
that have toiled for you are forever at rest3
how patiently he submitted while his daughter
pinned the clean, stiff, agonizing white collar
about his neck and brushed the little fiakes of
“ dander '' from the velvet collar of his best
coat; how he toiled up the long lonesome
stairs, not with the egotism of a half century
ago, but with the light of anticipated rest at
last in his eye ; obediently as he would go to
the dingy law office to have his will drawn,
he meekly leaves the outlines of his kind old
face for those he loved and for whom he has
so long labored.

It is a picture at which the thoughtless may
smile, but it is full of pathos, and eloquent for
those who knew him best. His attitude is
stiff, and his coat hunches up in the back, but
his kind old heart asserts itself through the
gentle eyes, and when 116 has gone away at
last we do not criticize the picture any more,
but beyond the old coat that hunches up in
the back, and that lasted him so long, we
read the history of a noble life.

Silently the old finger-marked album, lying
so unostentatiously on the gouty centre table,
points out the mile-stones from infancy to age,
and back of the mistakes of a struggling
photographer is betrayed the laughter and
the tears, the joy and the grief, the dimples
and the gray hairs of one man’s life time.

HOW WlLLIAM MILKED A GOW.

HEN Ι was young and used to roam
around over the country, gathering
water-melons in the light of the

moon, I used to think Ι could milk anybody’s
cow, but I do not think so now. I do not
milk a cow now unless the sign is right, and
it hasn't been right for a good many years.
The last cow Ι tried to milk was a common
cow, born in obscurity3 kind of a self-made
cow. I remember her brow was low, but she

wore her tail high and she was haughty‚ oh,
so haughty.

I made a common-place remark to her, one
that is used in the very best of society, one
that need not have given offence anywhere.
I said, “ So '’—and she “ soed.’' Then Ι told
her to “ hist'' and she histed. But Ι thought
she overdid it. She put too much expression
in it.

Just then I heard something crash through
