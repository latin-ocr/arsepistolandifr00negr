WASHINGTON ALLSTON.

“ With these 1 may not urge my suit,
Of Summer’s patient toil the sruit,
For mortal purpose given ;
Nor may it fit my sober mood
To sing of sweetly murmuring flood,
Or dyes of many colored wood,
That mock the bow of heaven,

“ But, know, 't was mine the secret power
That wakcd thee at the midnight honr
In bleak N ovember's reign:

’T was I the spell around thee cast,

When thou didst hear the hollow blast

In murmurs tell of pleasures past,
That ne’er would come again:

“And led thee, when the storm was o'er‚
To hear the sullen ocean roar,
By dreadful calm oppressed3
Which still, though not a breezc was
there,
Its mountain—billows heaved in air,
As if a living thing it were,
That strove in vain for rest.

‘⁴ 'T was I, when thou, suhdued by woe,
Didst watch the leaves descending slow,
To each a moral gave ;

And as they moved in mournful train,
With rustling sound, along the plain,

Taught them to sing a seraph's strain
Of peace within the grave.

“And then, upraised thy streaming eye,
Ι met thee in the western sky
In pomp of evening cloud;
That, while with varying form it rolled,
Some wizard's castle seemed of gold,
And now a crimsoned knight of old,
Or king in purple proud.

“ And last, as sunk the setting sun,
And Evening with her shadows dun
The gorgeous pageant past,
’T was then of life a mimic show,
Of human grandeur here below,
Which thus beneath the fatal blow
Of Death must fall at last.

“ O, fhen with what aspiring gaze
Didst thou thy tranced vision raise
To yonder orbs on high,
And think how wondrous‚ how sublime
'T wore upwards to their spheres to climb,
And live, beyond the reach of Time,
Child of Etcrnity ξ ’'

 

AN IMPRESSIVE VISION.
FROM “MONALD1.”

FTER waiting some time for my con-
ductor's return, and finding little worth
looking at besides the Lanfranc, I

turned to leave the chapel by the way Ι had
entered; but, taking a wrong door, I came
into a dark passage, leading, as I supposed,
to an inner court. This being my first visit
to a convent, a natural curiosity tempted me
to proceed, when, instead of a court, I found
myself in a large apartment. The light
(which descended from above) was so power-
ful, that for nearly a minute Ι could dis-
tinguish nothing, and I rested on a form

ᾗ attached to the wainscoating. Ι then put up

my hand to shade my eyes, when—the fearful
vision is even now before 1ne-—I seemed to be
standing before an abyss in space, boundless
and blaek.

In the midst of this permeable pitch stood
a colossal mass of gold, in shape like an altar,
and girdled about by a huge serpent, gorgeous
and terrible; his body ssecked with ‹liamonds,
and his head, an enormous carbuncle‚ floated
like a meteor on the air above. Such was
the Throne. But no words can describe the
gigantic Being that sat thereon—the grace,
the majesty, its transcendant form ; and yet I
shuddered as Ι looked, for its superhuman
countenance seemed, as it were, to radiate
falsehood; every feature was in contradiction
—the eye, the mouth, even to thc nostril—
whilst the expression of the whole was of that
unnatural softness which can only be con-
ceived of malignant blandishment. It was
the appalling beauty of the King of Hell.

The frightful discord vibrated through my
