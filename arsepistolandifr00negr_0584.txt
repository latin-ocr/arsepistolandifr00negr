Thou marshal‘st me the way that Ι was going ;

And meh 011 instrument 1 was to use.

Thus 10 mine eyes—Now o’er the one-half

Nature seems dead, 01111 wicked dreams abuse

T he 0111111111011 sleep; witchcraft celebrates

Pale Hecate‘s offerings3 and withered murder,

Alarmed by bis sentinel, the wolf,

Who howls his watch, thus with his stealthy

Moves like a ghost-.—Thou sure and firm-set

It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes ε

QUEEN MAB.

FROM “ROMEO AND JULIET.”

THEN I see, Queen Mab 110111 been The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;

She is the fairies’ midwife; and she The collars, of the moonshine’s watery beams3

comes
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of 011 alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart men’s noses as they lie asleep:
Her wagon-spokes made of long spinners’

legs ;

Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash‚ of film;
Her wagoner, a small gray-coated gnat,

Not half so big as a round little worm
Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid:

Her chariot is an empty hazel·nut‚

Made by the joiner squirrel‚ or old grub,
Time out of mind the fairies' conch-makers.
