MARCO BOZZARIS.

 

Τ midnight‚ in his guarded tent, At midnight, in the forest shades,
Α The Turk was dreaming of the hour Bozzaris ranged his Suliote band—
When Greeee, her knee in supplianee True 35 the steel of their tried mades,

Should tremble at his power. [1)6111, Heroes in beart and hand.

In dreams, through camp and court, he bore There had the Persian’s thousands stood,

The trophies of a conqueror; There had the glad earth drunk their blood >
In dreams his song of triumph heard ; On old Plataea's day3

Then wore his monareh's signet-ring— And now there breathed that haunted air

Then pressed that monareh's throne-a king ; The sons of sires who oonquered there,

As wild 1115 thoughts, and gay of wiug, With arms to strike, and souls to dare,
As Eden's garden bird. As quick, as far, as they.
