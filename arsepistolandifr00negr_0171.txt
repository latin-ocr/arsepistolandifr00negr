GEORGE BANC ROFT.

The following extracts, all from Bancroft's “ History of the United
States,’‘ convey an excellent idea of his graphio and attractive style, and
masterly treatment of persons and events:

EULOGIUM ΟΝ ANDREW JAOKSON.

Ο man in private life so possessed the
hearts of all around him——no public
man of this century ever returned to

private life with such an abidi ug mastery over
the affections of the people. No man with
truer instinct received American ideas—no
man expressed them so completely, or so
boldly or so sincerely. He was as sincere a
man as ever lived, He was wholly, always,
and altogether sincere and true. Up to the
last, he dared to do anything that it was right
to do. He united personal courage and
moral courage beyond any man of whom his-
tory keeps the record. Before the nation,
before the world, before coming ages, he
stands forth the representative, for his genera-
tion, of the American mind.

And the secret of his greatness is this: by
intuitive conception, 116 shared and possessed
all the creative ideas of his country and his
time. He expressed them with danntless in-
trepidity; he enforced them with an immov-
ahle will; he execnted them with an electi-ic
power, that attracted and swayed the Amer-
ican people. The nation, in his time, had not
onc great thought, of which he was not the
boldest and clearcst expositor.

History does not describe the man that
equalled him in firmness of nerve. Not

danger, not an army in battle array, not
wounds, not wide-spread clamor, not age, not
the angnish of diffuse, could impair, in the
least degree, the vigor of his steadfast mind.
The heroes of antiqnity would have conten]-
plated with awe the unmatched liardihood of
his character ; and Napoleon, had he possessed
his dis-inteream will, could never have been
vanquished. Andrew Jackson never was
He
conquered the wilderness; he conquered the
savage; he conquered the bravest veterans
trained in the. battle-fields of Europe; he
conquered everywhere in statesmanship; and,
when death came to get the mastery over him,
he turned that last enemy aside as tranquilly
as he had done the feeblest of his adversaries,
and escaped from earth in the triumphant
consciousness of immortality.

His body has its fit resting place in the
great central valley of the Mississippi; his
spirit rests upon our whole tcrritory; it
hovers over the vales of Oregon, and guards
in advance, the frontifssr of Del Norte. The
fires of party spirit are quenched at his grave.
His faults and frailtics have peris-hed, 111111-
ever of good he has done lives, and will live
forever.

Even so late as 1713, the number of seamen
did not excecd one hundred and twenty. The
soil had originally been justly divided, or
held as common property in trust for the pub-
lic, and for new comers. Forestalling was
successfully resisted ; the brood of speculatore
