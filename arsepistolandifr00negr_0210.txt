162 JOHN GoDFREY sAXE.

'Twas little condolence she had, God wat— And to make her cup >of woe run ov«
From“her troops of friends‚’' who hadn’tforgot Her elegant, ardent plighted lover
The airs she used to borrow; Was the vei y first to forsake her
They had civil phases enough, but yet ‘He quite regrettcd the step 'twas true .
'Twas plain to see that their “deepest regret” The Ιιᾱγ h· 1d pride nough‘ for two‚’
Was a different thing from sorrow! But that alone would never do

To quiet the butcher and baker ἔ ’“

And one of those chaps who make a pun,

As if it were quite legitimate fun

To be blazing away at every one

With a regular double-loadcd gun—
Remarked that moral transgression

Always brings retributive stings

To candle-makers as well as kings :

And now the unhappy Miss MacBride ·

The merest ghost of her early pride—
Bewails her lonely positio11;

Cramped in the very narrowest niche,

Abovc the poor, and below the rich—-
Was ever a worse condition?

 

For making light of cereous things '' MORAL.
WVas a very wick-ed profession ! Because you flourish in worldly affairs,
Don’t be haughty‚ and put on airs‚
And vulgar people—the saucy churls— With insolcnt pride of station Ξ
Inquired about “ the price of pearls,'' Don’t be proud and turn up your nose
And mocked at her situation: At poor-ei people m plainer clo’ es,
“ She wasn't ruined—they ventured to hope— But learn,f01 the sake of your mind' s reposo,
Because she was poor, she needn't mope; That wealth' s a bubble that comes—and goes 1,
Few people were better off for soap, And that all proud flesh, wherever it giows,
And that was a consolation 1 '² Is subject to irritation!
ECHO.
ASKED of Echo, ’t other day, Pray, should I act the wiser part
(those words are few and often funny)‚ To take the treasure, or forego it?
WVhat to a novice she could say Quoth Echo with decision———“ Go it! '’

Of courtship, love, and matrimony?

Quoth Echo, plainly—“ Matter-o’-m0ney!’' ΒΜ What if³ seemingly afraid

To hind her fate in Hymen’s fetter,

Whom should I marry ?-should it be She vow she means to die a maid,
A dashing damsel, gay and pert, In answer to my loving letter?
A pattern of inconstancy: . Quoth Echo, rather coolly———“ Let herl '⁹ Ἰ
Or selfish, mercenary flirt? , ‚ ¹ ⁸ ,
Quoth Echo, sharply——“Nary ffirt 5 υ What 1f, 1n spite of her disdaln,
I find my heart intwmed about
What if, aweary of the strife With Cupid's dear delicious chain
That long has lured the dear deceiver‚ So closely that Ι can't get out?
She promise to amend her life, Quoth Echo, laughingly—“ Get out! ”

And sin no more; can I believe her?

Quoth Echo, very promptly - ιι Leave But if some maid with beauty blest,

her1’' As pure and fair as Heaven can make her
Will share my labor and my rest
But if some maiden with a heart ⁴ Till envious Death shall overtake her?

On me should venture to bestow it, Quoth Echo (sotto voce)—“ Take her! ”
