He visited India after the great famine, or rather during its progress‚

and wrote graphio descriptions of it for various periodicals.

An extract

from one of his contributions is furnished herewith. Later, his work
embraced book reviews and miscellaneous articles for the “ North Amer-

ican,’‘ of Philadelphia.

BETTER HOME LIFE FOR CHILDREN.

VER since Dickens we have known that
a child fallen upon evil ways may be
trained to pick pockets or crawl into
windows for the benefit of burglars, and ever
and anon we hear of more serious cases, like
that of Jesse Pomeroy. There is no denying
these things. J uvenile depravity, as our
reformers say, is a sinister blot upon the fair
face of our specious civilization.

Nevertheless‚ there is in this nation a fund
of common sense, which manifestsitsclf more
at 501115 junctures than at others, which
prompts us, as a rule, to look upon our juve-
nile offenders as not fully and fatally responsi-
ble for their iniquities. We think that they
are more sinned against than sinning, and
that positive criminality 15 1111 accomplish-
ment which only men and women grown 1115
capable of.

We do not hang boy or girl murderers, and
when boys and girls steal, or otherwise offend
the majesty of technical law, we send them to
reformatories. Unluckily many of these in-
stitutions appear better calculated to turn
out criminal beginners as finished criminals
than to regenerate them. The putting together
of two juvenile scamps is prone to result in
the creation of as many deliberate rascals;
the pair compare notes, lay plots, encourage
and deprave each other, and come out worse
than they went in.

“Schools—more schools!'' cry the news-
papers‚ but it seems to me that if the cry
were, “ Families—better families! '' we would
be getting closer to the core of the matter.

We would be bringing it nearer home to us in
every sense of the word and putting ourselves
in a position to control the predicament at
first hand.

This brings 05 to the counsel of the clergy-
man to the children—that they should under
all circumstances honor their father and
mother, as the law of Sinai enjoins. It seems
to 1115 that no more puerile and perverse
advice could be given. That the relation of
parent is honorable and reverend 110 0115
would den y ; but that the special incumbents
of the position in a given case may be utterly
unworthy is quite plain.

suppose a child sees its father come in
drunk and kick and beat its mother; is it to
honor him? Suppose it sees its mother enter-
tain lovers while the father is absent at work;
is it to reverencc her? Suppose, in short,
that the father and mother, or either of them,
are criminal, vicious or degraded; shall the
child look up to them as honor-able persons
merely because they have given the child
birth? The absurdity of the question is the

answer to it.
Were the child old enough to comprehcnd

the distinction between reverencing the par-
ental principle and reverencing the special
examples of it which fate has given him, he
might still be asked to honor father and
mother; but, being a child, that is just what
he is incapable of doing. And if he were to
do it, what other logical result could be looked
for than that he should 'proceed to imitate in
his own conduct the practices of those hc so
