HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW. ’

flapping of 8 conqueror's banner, would blow they give humanity ussuranee of its greatness;

it out sor ever. The light of the soul is easily
extinguished.

And whenever I reflect upon these things
I become aware of the great importance, in
8 nation's history, of the individual fame
of scholars and literary men. Ι fear, that
it is far greater than the world is willing
to acknowledge; or, perhaps, 1 should say,
than the world has thought of acknowledging.
mot out from Englaud’s history the names of
Chaucer, Shakspeare‚ Spenser, and Milton
only, and how much of her glory would you
blot out with them! Take from Italy such
names as Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Michel
Angelo, and Raphael, and how much would
still be wanting to the completeness of her
glory! How would the history of Spain look
if the leaves were torn out, on which are
written the names of Cervantes, Lope de Vega,
and Calderon! that would be the fame of
Portugal, without her Camoens; of France,
without her Racine, and Rabelais, and Vol-
taire; or Germany, without her Martin Luther,
her Goethe, and Schiller!

N ay, what were the nations of old, without
their philosophers, poets, and historians? Tell
me, do not these mem in all ages and in all
places, emblazon with bright colors the arm-
oria] bearings of their country? Yes, and far
more than this; for in 811 ages and all places

and say, Call not this time or people wholly
barbarous; sor thus much, even then and
there, could the human mind achievel

But the boisterous world has hardly thought
of acknowledging 811 this. Therein it has
shown itself somewhat ungrateful. Else,
whence the great reproach, the general scorn,
the loud derision, with which, to take a
familiar example, the monks of the middle
ages are regard- d. That they slept their lives
away is most untrue. For in an age when
books were few—so few, so precious, that they
were often chained to their oaken shelves with
iron chains, like galley-slaves to their benches‚
these men, with their laborious hands, copied
upon parchment all the lore and wisdom of
the past, and transmitted it to us.

Perhaps it is not too much to say, that, but
sor these monks, not one line of the classice
would have reached our day. Surely, then,
we can pardon something to those supersti-
tious ages, perhaps even the mysticism of the
scholastic philosophy, since, after all, we can
find no harm in it, only the mistaking of the
possible for the real, and the high aspirings
of the human mind after a long-sought and
unknown somewhat. I think the name of

Martin Luther, the monk of Wittemberg‚
alone sufficient to redeem all monkhood from
the reproach of laziness!
