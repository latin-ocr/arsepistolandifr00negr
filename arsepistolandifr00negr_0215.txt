LITTLE BREEOHES.

 

' DON’T go much on religion, At last we struck hosses and wagon,
Ι never ain't had no show3 Snowed under a soft white mound,
But I’ve got a middlin' tight grip, sir, Upsot—dead beat—but of little Gabe
On the handful o’ things Ι know. No hide nor hair was found.
Ι don't pan out on the prophete
And free-will, and that sort of thing— And here all hope som-ed on me,
But I b’lieve in God and the angels, Of my fellow-eritters' aid,
Ever senee one night last spring. I jest flopped down on my marrowbones‚
Crotoh deep in the snow, and prayed.
Ι come into town with some turnips, By this, the torches was played out,
And my little Gabe come along— And me and Isrul Pari·
No four—year-old in the eounty Went off for some wood to a sheepfold
Could beat him for pretty and strong, That he said was somewhar thar.
Peart and chipper and sassy‚
Always ready 130 swear and fight-- XV& found it at last, and a little Shed
And I’d learnt him to ohaw terbaeker TVhere they shut up the lambs at night,
J est to keep his milk-teeth white, χ We lOOked in and seen then] huddled thar,
So warm and sleepy and white ;
The snow come down like a blanket And thar sot Little Breeohes and chirped,
As I passed by Taggart's store3 As peart as ever you see,
, Ι went in for a jug of molasses “ Ι want a ehaw of terbacker,
And left the team at the door. An' that's what’s the matter of me.''
They seared at something and started-—
I heard one little squall, How did he git thar? Augels,
And hell-to-split over the prairie He could never have walked in that storm;
Went team, Little Breeches and all. They jest seooped down and toted him
To whar it was safe and warm.
Hell-to-split over the prairie ; ⁷ And Ι think that saving a little child,
I was almost froze with skeer ; An’ fotohing him to his own,
But we rousted up some torches‚ Is a derned sight better business
And searched for 'em far and near. Thau loafing around the Throne.

 

JIM BLUDSO.

ALL, no! Ι can't tell where he lives, He warn’t no saint—them engineers
Because he don't live, you see; Is all pretty much alike—

Leastways, he's got out of the habit One wife in Natehez-under—the-Hill,
Of livin' like you and me. And another one here, in Pike.
, Whar have you been for the last three years, A careless man in his talk was J im,
That you haven't heard folks tell And an awkward man in a row——
How Jimmy Bludso passed in his checks, But he never pinked, and he never lied,

’ The night of the “ Prairie Belle? ’' Ι Ι reekon he never know'd how.
