THE ORGAN OF WESTMINSTER ABBEY.
FROM “THE sKETCH BOOK.”

HE sound of casual footsteps had ceased
from the abbey. Ι could only hear, now
and then, the distant voice of the priest

repeating the evening service, and the faint
responses of the choir; these paused for a
time, and all was hushed. The stillness, the
desei—tion and obscurity that were gradually
prevailing around, gave a deeper and more
solemn interest to the place:

For in the silent grave no conversation,

No joyful tread of friends, no voice of lovers,
No careful father's counsel——nothing's heard,
For nothing is, but all oblivion‚

Dust, and an endless darkness.

Suddenly the notes of the deep-laboring
organ burst upon the ear, falling with double
and redoubled intensity, and rolling, as it
were, huge billows of sound. How well do
their volume and grandeur accord with this
mighty building! With what pomp do they
swell through its vast vaults, and breathe their
awful harmony through these caves of death,
and make the silent sepulchre vocal! And
now they rise in triumph and acclamation,

BROKEN

HALL I confess it ?—1 believe in broken
hearts, and the possibility of dying of
disappointed love. I do not, however,

consider it a malady often fatal to my own
sex ; but I firmly believe that it withers down
many a lovely woman into au early grave.
How many bright eyes grow dim—how
many soft cheeks grow pale—how many lovely
forms fade away into the tomb, and none can
tell the cause that blighted their lovelinessl
As the dove will clasp its wings to its side, and
cover and conceal the arrow that is preyin g on
its vitals, so it is the nature of woman to hide
from the world the pangs of wounded affection.
· The love of a delicate female is always shy
and silent. Even when fortunate, she scarcely
breathes it to herself ; but when otherwise,

heaving higher and higher their accordant
notes, and piling sound on sound. And now
they pause, and the soft voices of the choir
break out into sweet gushes of melody; they
soar alost, and warble along the roof, and seem
to play about these lofty vaults like the pure
airs of heaven.

Again the pealing organ heaves its thrilling
thunders, compressing air into music, and roll-
ing it forth upon the soul. What long-drawn
cadences! What solemn sweeping concordsl
It grows more and more dense and powerful—
it fills the vast pile, and seems to jar the very
walls—the ear is stunned -— the senses are over-
whelmed. And now it is winding up in
full jubilee—it is rising from the earth to
heaven—The very soul seems rapt away and
floated upwards on this swelling tide of har-
mony!

1 sat for some time lost in that kind of rev-
erie which a strain of music is apt sometimes
to inspire: the shadows of evening were grad-
ually thickening round me; the monuments
began to cast deeper and deeper gloom; and
the distant clock again gave token of the
slowly waning day.

HEARTS.

she buries it in the recesses of her bosom, and
there lets it cower and brood among the ruins
of her peace.

With her the desire of the heart has failed.
The great charin of existence is at an end.
She neglects all the cheerful exercises which
gladden the spirits, quicken the pulses, and
send the tide of life in healthful currents
through the veins. Her rest is broken—thre
sweet refreshment of sleep is poised by melaz-2-
choly dreams——“ dry sorrow drinks her blood,'‘
until her eufeebled frame siuks under the
slighted external injury,

Look for her, after a little while, and you
will find friendship weeping over her untimely
grave, and wondering that one who but lately
glowed with all the radiance of health and
