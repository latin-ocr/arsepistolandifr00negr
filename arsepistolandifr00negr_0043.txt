HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW.

So the loud laugh of soom,

Out of those lips unshorn,

From the deep drinking-horn
Blew the foam lightly.

“ She was a prince’s child,

Ι but a Viking wild,

And though she blushed and smiled,
I was discarded !

should not the dove so white

Follow the sea-xnew's flight,
Why did they leave that night

Her nest un guarded ’Β

“ Scaree had I put to sea,
Bearing the maid with me—
Fairest of all was she

Among the Norsemen l—
When on the white sea-strand
&Vaving his armed hand,
Saw we old Hildebrand‚

With twenty horsernen.

“ Then launehed they to the blast,
Bent like a reed each mast,
Yet we were gaining fast,

When the wind failed us;
And with a sudden flaw
Came round the gusty Skaw,
So that our foe we saw

Laugh as he hailed us.

“ And as to catch the gale
Round veered the ssapping sail‚
Death! was the helsman's hail
Death without quarter!
Mid-ships with iron keel
Struek we her ribs of steel,
Down her black bulk did reel
Through the black water

“ As with his wings aslant
Sails the fierce cormorant,

Seeking some rocky haunt,
With his prey leden,
So toward the open main,
Beating to sea again,
Through the wild hurrieane
Bore I the maiden.

“ Three weeks we westward bore,
And when the storm was o'er,
cloud-like we saw the shore
Stretching to leeward :
There for my lady's bon-er
Built I the lofty tower,
Which, to this very honr,
Stands looking sea-ward.

‘⁶ There lived we man y years;
Time dried the maiden's tears;
She had forgot her feam,

She was a mother ;
Death closed her mild hlue eyes,
Under that tower she lives;
N e’er shall the sun arise

On such another!

“ still grew my bosom then,
still as a stagnant fen 1
Hateful to me were men,

The sun-light hateful 1
In the vast forest here,
Clad in my war-like gear,
Fell I upon my spear‚

O, death was grateful!

 

“ Thus, seamed with many scarS,
Bursting these prison bars,
Up to its native stars
My soul ascended!
j There from the flowing bowl
Deep drinks the warrior's soul,

Skoal ! to the N orthland 1 skoal! '’
ς —Thus the tale ended.

 

THE LAUNCHING OF THE SHIP.

LL is finished, and at length

Has come the bridal day

Of beauty and of strength,
To-day the vessel shall be launehed l
With fleeoy clouds the sky is blanched‚
And o’er the bay,
Slowly, in all its splendors dight,
The great sun rises to behold the sight.

The ocean old,

Centuries old,

Strong as youth, and as uneontrolled,
Paees restless to and fro,

Up and down the sands of gold.

His beating heart is not at rest;

And far and wide,
With ceaseless flow,
