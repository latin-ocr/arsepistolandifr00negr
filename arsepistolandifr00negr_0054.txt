Groves freshened as he looked, and flowers
Showed bright on rocky bank,

And fountaius welled beneath the boweis,
Where 11001· 31111 pheasant drank.

He saw the glittering streams ; he heard

The rnstling bongh and twittering bird.

And friends, the dead, in boyhood dear,
There lived 31111 walked agaim

And there was one who many a year
Within her grave had lain.

A fair young girl. the hamlet’s pride-—

His beart was breaking when she died.

WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.

Bounding, as was her wont‚ she came
Right towards his resting place,

And stretched her hand and called his name,
With that sweet smiling face.

For-ward with fixed and eager eyes,

The hunter leaned in act to rise:

Forward he leaned-—and headlong down
Plunged from that craggy wall ;

He saw the rocks, steep, 310111, 31111 brown

. An instant, in his fall—-

A frightful instant, and no more;

The dream and life at once were o’er.

THANATOPSIS.

O him who, in the love of Nature holds
Colninnnion with 1101 visible forms, she

A various language: for his gayer 1101113

Into his darker ninsings with a 1111111
And gentle synipathy, that steals away
Their sharpness, ere he is awai-e.

Of the last bitter hour come like a 11118111
Over thy spirit, and sad images
Of the stern agony, and shroud and pall,
And breathless darkness, and the narrow house
Make 11100 10 3113111101, and grow sick at heart,
Go forth under the open sky, and list
To nature's teachings, while from all 310111111-

Comes 3 31111 voice—yet a few days, and thee
The all-beholding 31111 shall see 110 111010
In all his conrse; nor yet in the cold ground,
Where thy pale form was laid, with many

Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist
Thy image. Earth that nourished thee, shall

To be 3 brother to the insensible rock,

Yet not to thine eternal resting·place

The venerable woods; rivers that move

The planets‚ all the infinite host of heaven,
Are shining on the sad abodes of death,
Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread
The globe 310 11111 a handful to the tribes
That slumber in its bosoni. Take the wings
Of morning, traverse Barca’s desert sands‚
Or lose thyself in the continuous woods
Where 10113 1110 Oregon, and hears no 30111111
Save his own dashings—yet the dead are
there!
And millions in those solitudes, since first
The flight of years began, have laid them down
In their last sleep—the dead reign there alone!
So 311311 111011 rest; and whatif thou withdraw
In silence from the living, and no friend
Take note of thy departure? All that breathe
Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh
