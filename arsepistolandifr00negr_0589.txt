WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY. 541

LITTLE BELEE.
HERE were three sailors of Bristol city WVhen Billy received this information

Who took a boat and went to sea, He used his pocket-handkerchie.
But first with beef and captain‘s bis· ο ·
cuits “ F1rst let me say my cateeh1sm,
And pickled pork they loaded she. WhiCh my P001' mammy taught t0 meff’
“ Make haste, make haste,'' says guzzling
There was gorging J aek and guzzling J immy, Jimmy,
And the youngest, he was little Billee. While Jaek pulled out his sniekersee.

Now, when they got as far as the equator,

They’d nothing left but one split pea, So Billy went up to the main top-gallant mast,

And down he fell on his bended knee.

Says gorging Jaek to guzzling J immy, He searee had come to the twelfth command-
“ I am extremely hungaree.’' ment
To gorging J ack says guzzling J immy, When up he jumps: “ There’s land I see :

“ We’ve nothing left, us must eat we.''
“ Jerusalem and Madagasoar,

Says gorging Jack to guzzling J immy, And North and South Amerikee:
‘⁶ With one another we shouldn't agree! There's the British flag a-riding at anehor,
There’s little Bill, he’s young and tender, With Admiral Napier, K. O. B.'’

We’re old and tough‚ so let’s eat he.'' ·
But when they got aboard of the admiral’s,

“ Oh, Billy, we'er going to kill and eat He hanged fat Jack and flogged Jin11uee;
you, But as for little Bill, he made him

So undo the button of your chemie.'’ The captain of a seventy-three,

SORROWS OF WERTHER.
ERTHER had a love for Charlotte So he sighed and pined and ogled,

Such as words could never utter; And his passion boiled and bubbled‚
Would you know how first he met her? Till he blew his silly brains out,
She was cutting bread and butter. And no more was by it troubled.
Charlotte was a married lady Charlotte, having seen his body
And a mortal man was NVerther, Borne before her on a shutter,
And for all the wealth of Indies Like a well-conducted person,
Would do nothing for to hu rt her. Went on cutting bread and butter.
