Elium> TAYLOR.

Traveller and Poet⁰

 

’ 'sss-q UCCESSFUL as a poet, a novelist, journalist and traveller, Mr.
² Taylor is a fine type of what may be called Yankee genius,
* ³ ‘⁰ ζ which has a remarkable power of adaptation. He touched many
‘⁴²' things, *illustrating the old Latin saying respecting Apollo,
“ He touched nothing that he did not adorn.’'

Bayard Taylor was born January 11th, 182 5, in the village
of Kennett Square, Chester County, Penna., of ancestors who formed part
of the original emigration with Penii. Educated at the usual country
schools, he became, at the age of seventeen, an apprentice 111 3 printing
office at the county borough 01 West Chester. His leisure time was spent
in the acquisition 01 Latin and French, and writing occasional verses,
which met with a favorable reception, as published 111 the New York Mir-

Griswold. ’

Δ Η15 success led him to collect his effusions, which were published in
a volume e11titled,Ximena and other Poems, in 1844. Τ1115 gave him
reputation sufficient 10 secure employment as a contributor 10 several
leading newspapers, while on a tour of Europe he had projected. With
the proceeds of his volume, one hundred dollars advanced by Chandler, 01

 

1116 U. S. Gazette, and Patterson, 01 1116 Saturday Evening Post, and forty
dollars for some additional poems, he started on his first travels, continued
at intervals, until he had visited every quarter 01 1116 globe, and become
the greatest traveller, for his years, that ever lived.

He spent two years in visiting England, Scotland, Germany, 511711-
zerland, Italy, and France, at an expense of only five hundred dollars,
travelling with a relative, and mostly on foot. On his return, in 1846, he
reprinted his letters to the papers in “ Views-a-foot, or Europe Seen with
. Knapsack and Staff.'’ The novelty of his mode of travelling, the youth
of the narrator, and the unusual vigor and freshness 01 1116 style, with the

quick perceptions 01 311 intelligent American mind, combined to create 311
