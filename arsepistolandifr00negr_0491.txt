FAVORITE POEMS AND PROSE SELECTIONS.

Midnight came with ebon garments and a
diadem of stars,

thile right upward in the zenith hung the
fiery planet Mars.

Hark! a sound of stealthy footsteps and of
’ voices whisperin g low,

‘Vas lt HOthmg bnt the young leaves' or the Β For their saintly heavts yearned o’er it in that

brooklet’s murmuring flow?

Glinging closely to each other, striving never ι

to look round,
As they passed with silent shudder the pale
corses on the ground.

Came two little maidens—sisters—with a
light and hasty tread,
And a look upon their faces, half of sorrow,

half of dread.

And they did not pause nor salter till, with
throbbing hearts, they stood

Where the drummer-boy was lying in that
partial solitude.

They had brought some simple garments from
their wardrobe’s scanty store,

And two heavy iron shovels in their slender
hands they bore.

Then they quickly knelt beside him, crushing
back the pitying tears,

For they had no time for weeping, nor for any
girlish fears.

And they robcd the icy body, while no glow
of maiden shame

flush of lambent flame.

honr of sorest need,
And they felt that Death was holy, and it
sanctified the deed.

But they smiled and kissed each other when
their new strange task was o'er,

And the form that lay before them its unwonted
garments wore.

Then with slow and weary labor a small grave
they hollowcd out,

And they lined it with the withvrvd grass and
leaves that lay about.

But the day was slowly breaking ere their
holy work was done,

Audin crimson pomp the morning heralded
again ‘the sun.

Gently then those little maidens—they were
children of our foes-—

Laid the body of our drummer-boy to undis-
tnrbed repose.

RESS 011! there's no such word as fail 3
Ρ Press nobly on 1 the goal is near ;
Ascend the mountain! breast the gale!
Look upward, onward-—never fear Ι [above
Why shouldst thou faint? Heaven smiles
Though storm and vapor intervene 3
That sun shines on, whose name is love,
Serenely o’er life's shadowed scene.

Press οη Ι surmount the rocky steepS‚
Climb boldly o'er the torrents’ arch 3
He fails alone who feebly creeps ;
He wins who dares the hero's march.

 

Be thou a hero l let thy might
Tramp on eternal snows its way,
And through the ebon walls of night,

Hew down a passage unto day.

Press οη ! if once, and twice thy feet
Slip back and stumble, harder try3

From him who never dreads to meet

Danger and death, they're sure to fly.
To coward ranks the bullet speeds;
While on their breasts who never quail,

; Gleams, guardian of chivalric deeds,

Bright courage, like a coat of mail.
