HENRY W. SHAW.

kus tent, gitting a peep under the kanvas when don't want a hen ov mine tew do it-—it iz apt

ever tha kan.

The man who fust brought the breed into
this kuntry ought to own them all and be
obliged tew feed them on grasshoppers‚ caught
bi hand.

Ι never owned but one, and he got choked
tu deth bi a kink in a clothes line, but not
until he had swallered 18 feet ov it.

Not enny shanghi for me, if you pleze; i
wuld rather board a travelling kolporter, and
as for eating one, give me a biled owl rare
dun, or a turkee buzzard, roasted hole, and
stuffed with a pair ov injun rubber boots‚ but
not enny shanghi for me, not a shanghi!
Speaking ov 116116,163(16 me tew remark, in the
fust place, that 116116, 111116 far, are a suckcess.
They are domestick, and occasionally are tuff.
This iz owing tew their not being biled often
enuff in their younger (1326 ; 11111 the hen aint
tew blame for this. Biled hen iz universally
respekted.

Thare is a great deal ov originality tew the
hen—exactly how mutch i kant tell, historians
fight so muteh about it. Sum say Knower had
116116 111 1116 3111 311(1 601116 say he didn’t. So it
8066, which and tuther. I kant tell yu which
was born fust, the hen or the egg ; sumtimes I
think 1116 688 waz-——and sumtimes i think 1116
11611 waz—-and sumtimes i think i don’t kno
and 1 kant tell now, which way iz right, for
the life ov me, Laying eggs iz the hen's best
grip. A hen that kant lay eggs iz laid out.
One eg iz konsidered a fair day's work tor a
hen. I hav herd ov their doing better, but i

tew hurt their constitution and bye-laws, and ¹

thus impare their futer worth. The poet ses,
butifully,

‘⁴ Sumboddy haz stolen our old blew hen!
I wish they'd let her bee;

She used tew lay 2 6886 3 day,
And Sunday she'd lay 3.”

This sounds trew enuff for poetry, but iwill ·

bet 75 thousand dollars that it never took >

place. The best time tew sett a 11611 12 when .
the hen iz reddy. I kant tell you what the ¹
best breed iz, bul the shanghi is the meanest.

It kosts as mutch tew board one as it duz a 3

stage 11066, 311(1 yu might as well undertake tew γ
fat a fanning mill, by running oats thru it. ,⁴ v

Thare 31111 110 proffit in keeping a hen for his
eggs, if he 1326 1666 111311 0116 3 day.
Hens are very long lived, if they dont con- ,

trakt the thrut disseaze——thare is 3 great ¹·

menny goes tew pot, every year, bi this melan-
kolly disseaze. I kant tell 6113611)γ how tew .
pick out 3 80οᾶ 11611, 11111 36 3 general thing, ’
the long eared ones are kounted the best.
The one legged 01166, 1 11116, are the less apt
tew skratoh up a garden. Ζ
Ε886 packed in equal parts ov salt, and lime ,
water, with the other end down, will keep from
30, or 40, years, if they are not disturbed.
Fresh bees-stake iz good for hens; i serpose
4 or 5 pounds a day would be awl a hen would
need, at fust along. ⁸ τ
Ι shall be happy to advise with yu, at enny “
time, on the hen question, and take it in egg.
