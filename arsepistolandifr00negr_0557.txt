“ Most extraordinary female thisj’ thought
ΜΓ. Pickwick, popping in again. “ Ha-hum !''

“ Gracious Heaven 1 '’ said the middle-aged
lady, “ what's that ?’'

“ It's—-it's——only a gentleman, ma’am,” said
Mr. Pickwick from behind the cuitains.

“ A gentleman ! '' said the lady, with a ter-
rific scream.

“ It's all over,'' thought Mr. Pickwick.

“ A strange man 1'' shrieked the lady. An-
other instant and the house would be alarmod.
Her garments rustled as she rushed towards

the door.

“ Ma'am ! ’' said Mr. Pickwick, thrusting
out his head, in the extremity of his despera-
tion, “ ma'am 1 ”

“ VVretch,” said the lady, covering her eyes
with her hands, ‘⁴ What do you want here? ’²

“ Nothing, ma'am - nothing whatever,
ma'am,'’ said Mr. Pickwick, earnestly.

“ Nothing 1 '' said the lady, looking up.

“ Nothing, ma’am, upon my honor,'’ said
Mr. Pickwick, nodding his head so energetic-
ally that the tasscl of his night-cap danced
again. “I am almost ready to sink, ma'am,
because of the confusion of addressing a lady
in my night-cap (here the lady hastily snatched
off her's), but Ι can't get it off, ma'am (here
Mr. Pickwick gave it a tremendous tug in
proof of the statement). It is evident to me,
ma'am, now, that Ι have mistaken this bed-
room for my own. Ι 113(1 not been here five

DICK EN S. 503
minutes, ma'am, when you suddenly en-
tered it.”

“If this improbable story be really true,
sir,’' said 1110 lady, sobbing violently, “you
will leave it instantly.’'

“ I will, ma'am,'' with the greatest pleasure,”
replied Mr. Pickwick,

“ Instantly, sir,'' said the lady.

‘⁴ Certainly, ma'am,” interposed Mr. PM<-
wick, very quickly. “ Certainly, ma'am. 1-—
I—-am very sorry, ma'am,'’ said Mr. Pick-
wick, making his appearance at the hattoni
of the bed, “to have been the innocent ocea-
sion of this alarm and emotion; deeply sorry,
ma'am.''

The lady pointed to the door.

“ Ι 3111 exceedingly sorry, ma'am,'' said Mr.
Pickwick, bowing very low.

“ If you are, sir, you will at once leave the
r001n,'' said the lady.

“ Immediately ma'am ; this instant, ma'a1n‚’'
said Mr. Pickwick, opening the door, and
dropping both his shoes with a loud crash in
sc) doing. “ Ι trust, ma'am,'’ resumed ΜΓ.
Pickwick, gathering up his shoes, and turn-
ing round to bow again, “ Ι trust, ma'am, that
my unblemished. character, and the devoted
respect Ι entertain for your sex, will plead as
some slight excuse for this—’² But before
Mr. Pickwick could conclude the sentence,
the lady had thrust him into the passage, and
locked and bolted the door behind him.

 

REGOLLEOTIONS OF MY GHRISTMAS TREE.

HAVE been looking on, this evening‚ at a
merry company of children asseinbled
round that pretty German toy, a Christ-

mas tree.

Being now at home again, and alone, the
only person in the house awake, my thoughts
are drawn back, by a fascination which I do
not care to resist‚ to my own childhood.
Straight 111 the middle of the room, cramped
in the freedom of its growth by no encircling
walls or soon-reached ceiling, a shadowy tree
arises3 and, looking up into the dreamy bright-
ness of its top,--for Iobserve in this tree the
singular property that it appears to grow

downward towards the earth,—I look into my
youngest Clu-istmas recollections.

All toys at first, Ι find. But upon the
branches of the trce, lower down, how thick
the books begin to hang! Thin books, in
themselves, at first, but many of them, with
deliciously smooth covers of bright red or
green. What fat black letters to begin with !

“ A was an archer, and shot at a frog.'’ Of
course he was. He was an apple-pie also, and
there he is! He was a good many things in
his time, was A, and so were most of his
friends, except X, who had so little versatility
that I never knew hini κ) get beyond Xerxes
