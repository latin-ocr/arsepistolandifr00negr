494 LORD BYRON.

To this passage the following note is appended by the author:
“When very young, about eight years of age, after an attack of the
scarlet fever at Aberdeen, Ι was removed by medical advice, into the
Highlands. Here Ι passed occasionally 'some summers, and from this
period Ι date my love of mountainous countrieS. Ι can never forget the
effect, a few years afterwards in England, of the only thing Ι had long
seen, even in miniature, of a mountain in the Malvern Hills. After Ι
returned to Cheltenham, Ι used to watch them every afternoon at sunset,
with a sensatiou which Ι cannot describe. This was boyish enough3 but
Ι was then only thirteen years of age, aud it was in the holidays.''

In the year 1798, on the death of his grand uncle, he became a
chancery ward under the guardianship of ⁵ the Earl of Carlisle, against
whom he soon conceived a dislike. Placed at Harrow, he had to en-
counter all the temptations and annoyances inseparable from public edu-

Byron was perpetually called to mind by the rudest practical sarcasms.
He would often wake, and find his lame foot plunged in a pail of water.
Through Harrow he fairly “fought his way.’'

In October, 1805, the young lord entered Cambridge University,
where he was little distinguished for application, and showed no great
respect for academie honors. He even evinced his contempt for them
by keeping a young bear in his room, which he said he was trainiug for

a fine old building which he proceeded immediately to repair. His
“ Hours of IdleneSS,'' now appeared, a collection of poems written during
his minority, which was attacked by the “ Edinburgh Review,'' with a de-
gree of malignity and violence that provoked the youthful bard to vindi-
cate his reputation in a satire entitled “ English Bards and Scotch Re-
viewers.'' This severe and sweeping philippic appeared a few days after
he had taken his seat in the House of Lords, and gained the favor of the
public in a short time. He soon after went abroad, traveling through
Portugal, Spain and Greece. The scenes through which he passed are
finely described in “ Childe Harold's Pilgrimage.'' In the east he swam
from Sestos to Abydos, and prided himself greatly on this daring feat.
He returned to England in 1811, after an absence of two years.

He hastened to Newstead, but arrived too late to close the eyes of
his mother. About this period the acquaintance between himself and
the poet Thomas Moore commenced—an acquaintance which afterwards
