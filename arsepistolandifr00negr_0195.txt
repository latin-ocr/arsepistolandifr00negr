OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES. 149

“Lectures on Popular Delusions 111 Medicine,'’ and the “Theory and
Praetice,’' by himself and Dr. Bigelow. His other compositions in prose
consist of occasional addresseS, and papers in the “North American

Review.’'
The earlier poenis of Dr. Holmes appeared in “The Collegian.’'

They were little less distinguished for correct and melodious versification
than his more recent and most elaborate productions. They attracted
attention by their humor and originality, and were widely republished in
the periodicals.

After resigning his professorship of Anatomy and Physiology in
Dartmouth Collegc, Dr. Holmes was chosen in 1847 to fill the same chair
at Harvard University. That he was popular among his pupils can easily
be believed. Around 3 very dry subject he threw the sunshine of his wit,
fired off anecdotes and jokes, and interested the students in 3 subject
which, without his genial presentation, would have been very unattractive.

In 1857—58 he contributed to the ‘⁴ Atlantic Monthly '' ‘⁴ The Auto-
crat of the Breakfast-Table,’' which was followed 111 1859 by “The Pro-
fessor 31 1116 Breakfast—Table,'’ and in 1872 by “ The Poet 31 1116 Breakfast—
Table.’' These contributions abound in humor and wit and exhibit a
shrewd insight into human nature. His other principal productions are
“ Elsie Venner,’' issued in 1861 ; “The Guardian Angel,'' in 186&
besides numerous minor works, among which 316 “ Songs of Many Sea-
sons,'’ 3 collection of poems published in 18743 “John L. Motley, 3
Memoir,'’ brought out in 1878; “The Iron Gate and other Poe1ns,'‘ 111
, 1880, and 3 biography of Emerson in 1885. These are the principal
writings of our distinguished poet and humorist. He was long a conspic-
uous character in Cambridge and Boston, was never thought of in any
other way than as a genial friend, a brilliant writer and 311 estimable citi-
zen. He died October 7, 1894.

Dr. Holmes is a poet of art and humor and genial sentiment, with 3
style remarkable for its purity, terseness, and point, and for an exquisite
finish and grace. His lyrics ring and sparkle like cataracts of silver, and
his serious pieces—-as successful in their way as those mirthful frolics of
his muse for which he is best known—arrest the attention by touches of
the most genuine pathos and tenderness. All his poems illustrate 3
manly feeling, and have in them a current of good sense, the more charm-
’ ing becau'se somewhat out of fashion now in works of imagination and

fancy.
