WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE. 481

Confessedly the first of parliamentary orators, and the greatest
preponderating force in the politics of our time, his strong personality

impressed itself upon all ranks and classes of the people. His public

career covered more than half a century of most momentous years in the
‘s- annals of Great Britain. There have been periods in English history

ἶ which have been marked by greater social upheavals and more violent
⁷ revolutions; there have been even national convulsions resulting some-
times in a change of dynasty3 but there has been no period which can
11- compare with the last fifty years of the nineteenth century for the vast
number of reforms which were peaceably effected—reforms ecclesiastical‚
ζ social, colonial, financial, and political. And with all these vast and pro-
ζ gressive changes, the name of William Ewart Gladstone was more or
t: less inextricably interwov en.

 

Edward Arnold pays the following glowing tribute to Mr. Gladstone:
