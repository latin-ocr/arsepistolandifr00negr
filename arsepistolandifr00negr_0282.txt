SPELLING DOWN THE MAS'I'ER.
FROM “THE Hoosmn sonoonMASTER.”

BY PERMISSION 01³· THE AUTHOR:

VERY family furnished a candle. There
were yellow dips and white dips, burn·
ing, smoking‚ and fiaring. There was

laughing and talking, and gigghng, and sim-
pering, and ogling, and fiirting, and courting.
that a dress party is to Fifth avenne, a spell-
ing—school is to Hoophole County, It is an
occasion which is metaphorically inscribed
with this legend, “Choose your partners.”
Spelling is only a blind in Hoophole Couuty,
as is dancing on Fifth Avenue. But as there
are some in society who love dancing for its
own sake, so in Flat Greek district there were
those who loved spelling for its own sake, and
who, smelling the battle from afar, had come
to try their skill in this tournament, hoping
to freshen the laurels they had won in their
school-days.

“ I 'low,'' said Mr. Means, speaking as the
principal school trustee, “I ’low our friend
the Square is jest the man to boss this ere
consarn to-night. Ef nobody objects, I'll
appoint him. Come, Square, don't be bashful.
Walk right up to the trough, fodder or no
fodder, as the man said to his ‹lonkey.''

There was a general giggle at this. and
many of the young swains took occasion to
nudge the girls alongside them, ostensihly for
the purpose of making them see the joke, but
really for the pure pleasure of nudging.

The squire came to the front.

“ Ladies and gentle1nen,'' he began, shovin g
up his spectacles, and sucking his lips over
his white teeth to keep them in place, “ ladies
and gentlemen, young men and maidens,
raley I'm obleeged to Mr. Means fer this
honor‚'' and the Squire took both hands and
turned the top of his head round several
inches. Then he adjusted his speetacles.

shi p, in my weak way and manner.''

This burst of eloquence was delivered with '

a constrained air and an apparent sense of
danger that he, Squire Hawkins, might fall
to pieces in his weuk way and manner, and
of the success and futility (especially the
latter) of all attempts at reconstruction. For
by this time the ghastly pupil of the left eye,
which was black‚ was looking away round to
the left, while the little blue one on the right
twinkled oheerfully toward the front. The
front teeth would drop down so that the
Squire's mouth was kept nearly closed, and
his words whistled through.

It is spelling yon want. Spelling is the
corner-stone, the grand, underlying subterfuge
of a good eddication. Ι put the spellin'-book

side the Bible. Ι do raley. The man who
compounded this little work of inextricable
valoo was a benefactor to the whole human
race or any other.'' Here the spectacles fell
off. The Squire replaced them in some con-
fusion, gave the top of his head another
twist, and felt for his glass eye, while poor
Shocky stared in wonder, and Betsy Short
rolled from side to side in the effort to sup-
press her giggle. Mrs. Means and the other
old ladies looked the applause they could not
speak.

“I appint Larkin Lanham and Jeemes
Buchanan fer captings,'' said the Squire. And
the two young men thus named took a stick
and tossed it from hand to hand, to decide
who should have the “first chice.” One
