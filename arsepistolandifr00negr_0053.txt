WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT. 35,

Six white eggs on a bed of hay,
Flecked with purple, a pretty sight!
There as the mother sits 311 day,
Robert is singing with all his might:
Bob-o’-link, bob-o’-link,
Spink‚ spank, spink ;
Nice good wife, that never goes out,
Keeping house with a frolie about.

Chee, chee, 61166.

Soon as the little ones ehip the shell
Six wide mouths are open for food ;
Robert of Lincoln bestirs him well;
Gathering seed for the hungry brood.
Bob-o’-link, bob—o’-link‚
Spink‚ spank, spink;
This new life is likely to be
Hard for a gay young fellow like me.

Chee, chee, 61166.

Robert of Lineoln at length is 11111116
Sober with work, and >ihm wilh care,
Off in his holiday garment laid,

Half forgotten that merry air,
Bob-o’-link‚ bob-o’-linl<,
Spink, spank, spink ;

Nobody knows but my mate and I

Where our nest and nestlings lie.
Chee, ehee‚ chee.

Summer wanes; the children are grown
Fun and frolie no more he knows ;
Robert of Lincoln’s a hnmdrnm crone3
Off he flies, and we singr as he goes :
Bob-o’-link‚ bob-o'-link,
Spink. spank, spink ;
11711611 you 6311 pipe that meri-y old 51111111
Robert of Lineoln‚ come back again.

 

THE} LOVE I BEAR.

LEXIS calls me cruel ;
The ritted erags that hold
The gathered 166 of winter,
He says, are not more cold:

11711611 even the very blossoms
Around the fountain's brim,

And forest walks, 6311 witness
The love I bear to him.

Ι would that I could utter
My feelings without shame!

And tell him how I love him,
Nor wrong my virgin fame.

Alas l to seize the moment
When heart inclines 10 116311,

And press a 51111 with passion,
Is not 3 woman’s part.

If man eomes not 10 gather
The roses where they stand,
They fade among their foliage ;
They cannot seek his hand.

 

THE HUN'I'ER’ S VISION.

PON a rock that, high and 511661·
Rose from the mountain’s breast
A weary hunter of the deer
Had sat him down to rest,
And bared to the soft summer air
His hot red brow and sweaty hair.

All dim in haze the mountains lay,
With dimmer vales between ;

And rivers glimmered on their way,
By forests faintly seen ;

While ever rose a murmuring sound‚

From brooks below and bees around.

He listened, till he seemed to hear,
A„ 5113511. so soft and low

That whether in the mind or 631
The listener scaree might know ;

With such a tone, so sweet, 50 1111111,

The watohing mother lulls her child.

“ Thou weary 111111151111111,” thus it said,
“Thou faint with 1011 and 11631,

Τ116 pleasant land of rest is spread
Before thy very feet,

And those whom thou wouldst gladly see

Are waiting there to weleome 11166.’1

Η6 looked, and ’twixt the earth and sky
Amid the noontide haze,

A shadowy region met his eye,
And grew beneath his gaze,

As if the vapors of the 1111

Had gathered into 51151165 50 fair.
