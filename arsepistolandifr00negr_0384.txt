of people‚ the enterprise suddenly grew in
proportions and challenged their sels-suffi-
ciency; yet, as I have heard them confess,
they did not wake to a perfect comprehension
of their situation and its dangers and difficul-
ties, unless they passed the gates of Xoloc;
then Tenochtitlan shone upon them—a city
of enchantment.

And then each one felt that t) advance was
like marching in the face of death, at the
same time each one saw there was uo hope ex-
cept in advance. Every hand grasped closer
thc weapon with which it was armed, while
the ranks were intuitively closed. What

As if aware of the influence and fearful of 2

its effect upon his weaker followers, Gortez ’-

spoke to the musicians‚ and trumpet and
clarion burst into a strain which, with beat of
drum and clash of cymbal, was heard in the
city.

DEA'I'H OF MONTEZUMA.
FROM “THE FAIR GODJ’

HE king turned his pale face and fixed
his gazing eyes upon the conqueror3
and such power was there in the look

that the latter added, with softening manner,
“ that I can do for thee I will do. I have
always been thy true friend.''

“O Malinche‚ I hear you, and your words
make dying easy,'' answered Montezuma,
smilling faintly.

With an effort he sought Cortez' hand, and
looking at Acatlan and TecalcO, continued:

“ Let me intrust these women and their
children to you and your lord. Of all that
which was mine but now is yours—landS, peo-
ple, empire,—enough to save them from want
and shame were small indeed. Promise me;
in the hearing of all these, promise, Malinche.”

Taint of anger was there no longer on the
soul of the great Spaniard.

“ Rest thee, good king!'’ he said, with feel-

that this lingering in death is no fault of his;
the aim was true, but the arrow splintered
upon leaving the bow. And lest the world
hold him to account for my blood, hear me
say, all of you, that I bade him do what he
did.

“And in sign that I love him, take my
sceptre, and give it to him—”

His voice fell away, yet the lips moved;
lower the accents stooped,—

“ Tulo and the empire go with the sceptre,''
he murmured, and they were his last words,—

his will. A wail from the women pronounced
him dead.
