of sin. I could look no longer.

As I turned, the prior was standing before
me. “YeS‚’' said he, as if replying to my
thoughts, “it is indeed terrific. Had you be-

ever did so.''

ROSALIE.

POUR upon my soul again
That sad, unearthly strain,
yThat seems from othei w orlds too pl·1in;
Thus falling, falling from afar,
As if some melancholy star
Had mingled with her light her siglis,
And dropped them from the skies.

No—never came from aught below
This melody of woe,

That makes my heart to overflow

As from a thousand gushing springs

Unknown hefor0; that with it brings

This nameless light—if light it be—
That veils the world Ι see.

For all I see around me wears
The hue of other sphe1·es;
And something blent of smiles and tears
Comes from the very air I breathe.
O, nothing, sure, the stars beneath,
Can mould a sadness like to this—
So like angelic bliss.

So, at that dreamy hour of day,
When the last lingering ray
Stops 011 the highest cloud to play-—

So thought the gentle Rosalie

As on her maiden revery

First fell the strain of him who stole
In music to her soul. ·

THE SPANISH MAID.

IVE weary months sweet Inez number-ed
From that unfuding bitter day

XVhen last she heard the trumpet bray

That called hei· Isidor away—
That never to her beart has slumbered ;

She hears it now, and scos, far bending
Along the mountain's misty side,
His plumed troop, that, waving wide,
Seems like a rippling, seathery tide,

Now bright, now with thc dim shore blending

She hears the caunon's dendly rattle—
And fancy hurries on to strife,

And hears the drum and screaming fife

Mix with the last sad ery of life.
O, should he—should he fall in battle!

Yet still his name would live in story,
And every gallant bard in Spain
Would fight his battles o'er again.
And would not she for such a strain

Resign him to his eountry’s glory?

Thus Inez thought, and plucked the flower
That grew upon the very bank
Where first her ear bewildered drank
The plighted vow—where last she sank
In that too bitter parting hour.
