ute, and only four remained3 and the parent
birds were very sad, and there was no song
all that day, nor the next. Soon the little
birds were big enough to fly; and great was
their parents' joy to see them leave the nest,
and sit crumpled up upon the branches.
There was then a great time. One would
have thought the two old birds were two
French dancing-masters, talking and chatter-
ing and scolding the little birds to make them

go alone.
The first bird that tried flew from one

branch to another, and the parents praised
him ; and the other little birds wondered how he
vdid it. And he was so vain of it that he tried
again, and flew and flew, and couldn’t stop
flying, till he fell plump down by the house-
door; and then a little boy caught him and
carried him into the house, and only three
birds were lest. Then the old birds thought
that the sun was not as bright as it used to be,
and they did not sing as often.

In a little time the other birds had learned
to use their wings; and they flew away and
away, and found their own food, and made
their own beds; and their parents never saw
them any more.
