22 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW.

“O father, I 11881· 1118 church-bells ring!
Ο say, what may it be?’'

‘¹ ' Tis 8 sog-bell on a rock-bound coast,”
And 118 steered for the open sea.

“ O father, I hear the sound of guns!
O say, what may it be ?”

“ 801118 ship in (11311833, that cannot live
In such an angry sea l ”

‘⁴ O father, Ι 388 8 gleaming light!
O say, what may it be ‘3 '’
But the father answered never a word-—
A frozen corpse was he!

Lashed to thc 1181111 811 311111 and stark,
With his face to the skies,
The lanterii gleamed through the gleaming
suow

On his fixed and glassy eyes.

Theu the maiden clasped her hands and
prayed,
That saved she might be ;
And she thought of Christ, who stilled the
waves,

On the lake of Galilee.

And fast through the midnight dark and

Throiigiliuthe whistling sleet and snow,
Like a sheeted ghost‚ the vessel swept,
Towards the reef of Norman’s 11Το8.

’ And ever, the fitful gusts between,

A sound came from the la d :
It was the sound of the trampling surf
On the rocks, and 1118 hard sea-saud.

The breakers were right beneath her bows,
She drifted a drea ry wreck,

And a whooping billow swept the crew,
Like icicles, from her deck.

She struck, where the white and fleecy waves
Looked soft as carde-d wool ;

But the cruel rocks they gored her side
Like the horus of an angry bull.

Her rattling shrouds, all sheathed in 188,
With the 1118313, went by the board;

Like a vessel of glass, she stove and sank—
Ho! ho! the breakers roared'.

At daybreak, on the bleak sea—beach,
A fisherman stood aghast,

To see 1118 form of a maiden fair
Lashed 81038 10 8 drifting mast.

The salt sea was frozen on her breast,
The salt tears in her eyes ;

And he saw her hair, like the brown sea-weed
On the billows fall and rise.

Such was the wreck of the Heffierus,
In the midnight, and the snow ;

Christ save us all from 8 death like this,
On the reef of N orman's Woe.

 

THE VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.

NDER 8 spreading chestnut-tree
The village smithy stands;
The 31111111, 8 mighty man is he,
With large and sinewy hands;
And the muscles of his brawny arm
Are strong as iron bands.

His hair is crisp and black and long:
His faceis like the tan;

His hrow is wet with honest sweat,-—
118 earns whate'er he can,

And looks the whole world in the face,
For 118 owes not any man.

Week in, week out, from morn till night,
You can hear his bellows blow ;

You can hear him swing his heavy sledge
With measured beat and slow,

Like a sexton ringing the village bell,
When the evening sun is low.

And children coming home from school,
Look in at the open door;

They love to see the fiaming forge,
And hear the bellows mar,

And catch the burning sparks that fly
Like chaff from the threshing floor.

He goes on Sunday to the church,
And sits among his boys;
He hears the parson pray and prcach 1
He hears his daughter's voice,
Singing in the village choir‚
And it makes his heart rejoice.
It sounds to him like her mother’s voice,
Singing in Paradise !
