MRS. OAUDLE ΟΝ LENDING UMBRELLAS.

AH! that's the third umbrella gone since
Christmas. What were you to do?
Why, let him go home in the rain, to

be sure. I'm very certain there was nothing
about him that could spoil! Take cold, in-
deed! He doesn’t look like one of the sort to
take cold. Besides, he’d 113116 better taken
cold than taken your umbrella. Do you hear
the rain, Mr. Caudle‘? Ι say, do you hear
the rain? Do you hear it against the win-
dows? Nonsense: you don’t ilnpose upon
me ; you can't be asleep with such a shower
as that! Do you hear it, Ι say? Oh! you
do hear it! well, that’s a pretty flood, I
think, to last for six weeks; and no stirring
all the time out of the house. Pooh! don't
think me a fool, Mr. Caudle: don'tinsult me ;
he return the umbrella? Anybody would
think you were born yesterday. Asis any-

body ever did return an umbrella!
There: do you hear it? Worse and worse.

Cats and dogs! and for six weeks ; always six
weeks: and no umbrella! Ι should like to
know how the children are to go to school to-
morrow. They sha’n’t go through such
weather3 I am determined. No; they shall

stop at home and never 163111 anything, (the
blessed creatures!) sooner than go and get
wet! And when they grow up, Ι wonder
whom they'll have to thank for knowing

nothing; whom, indeed, but their father?
People who can’t feel for their own children

ought never to be fathers.

But I know why you lent the umbrella:
oh, yes, Ι know very well. Ι was going out
to tea at dear mother’s to-morrow ; you knew
that, and you did it 011 purpose. Don’t tell
me; you hate to have me to go there, and
take every mean advantage to hinder me.
But don’t you think it, Mr. Caudle; no, sir;
if it eomes ‹lown in buckets full, I'll go all
the more. No; and I'll not have a cab!
VVhere do you think the money's to come
from? You've got nice, high notions at that
club of yours. A cab, indeed! Cost me six-
teen-peuce, at least3 sixteen-peuce! two-and-
eight-pence3 for there’s back again. Cabs,
indeed! I should like to know who's to pay
for 'em ; for Ι 3111 sure you can’t, if you go on
as you do, throwing away your property, and
beggaring your children, buying umbrellas!

Do you hear the rain, Mr. Caudle? I say,
