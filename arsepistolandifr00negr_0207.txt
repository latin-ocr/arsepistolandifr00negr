WILLIAM HICKLING PRESCOTT.

assemblage of water, woodland, and cultivated
plains, its shining cities and shadowy hills, was
spread out like some gay and gorgeous pano-
rama before them. Stretehing far away at
their feet were seen noble forests of Oak, syca-
more, and cedar, and beyond, yellow fields of
maize and the towering maguey, intermingled
with orchards and blooming gardens; for flow-
ers, in such demand for their religious festi-
vals, were even more abundant in this popu-
lous valley than in other parts of Anahuac.
In the centre of the great basin were beheld
the lakes, oceupying then a much larger por-
tion of its surface than at present ; their bor-
ders thickly studded with towns and hamlets,
and, in the midst—like some Indian empress,
with her coronal of pearls—the fair city of
Mexico, with her white towers and pyramida]
temple, reposing, as it were, 011 1110 bosom of
the waters—the far-famed “Venice of the
Aztecs.'’

High over all rose the royal 11111 of (111311111-
tepeo, the residence of the Mexican 111011310115,
crowned with the 531110 grove of gigantic
cypresses, which at this day ssing their broad

shadows over the land. In the distance
beyond the blue waters of the lake, and nearly
screened by intervening foliage, was seen a
shining speck, the rival capital of Tezcuco,
and, still further on, the dark belt of por-
phyry, girdling the valley around like a rich
setting which nature had devised for the fair-
est of her jewels.

Such was the beautiful vision which broke
on the eyes of the conqueror-s. And even
now, when 50 sad a change has come over the
scene; when the stately forests have been laid
low, and the 5011, unsheltered from the fierce
radiance of a tropical sun, is in many places
abandoned to sterility; when the waters have
retired, leaving a broad and ghastly margin
white with the incrustation of salts‚ while the
cities and hamlets on their borders have
mouldered into ruins ;—even now that desola-
tion broods over the landscape, so indestructi-
1110 310 1110 111105 of beauty which nature has
traced on its features, that no traveler, how-
ever cold‚ can gaze on them without secret
wonder and admiration.

THE PROFESSION OF LITERATURE.
FROM A PAPER 011 50011.

T is not very easy 10 500 011 what this low
estimate of literature rested. As a profes-
sion, it has too little in common with more

active ones 10 afford much ground for running
a parallel. The soldier has to do with exter-
nals3 and his eontests and triumphs are over
matter in 115 various forms, whether of man 01·
material nature. The poet deals with the
bodilcss forms of air, of fancy lighter than air.
His business 15 contemplative, the other’s 15
active, and dcpends for its success on strong
moral energy and presence of mind. He
must, indeed, have genius of the highest order
to effect his own combinations‚ anticipate the
movements of his enemy, and dart with eagle
· eye on his vulnerable point. But who shall
say that this practical genius, if we may 50 term

1 it, 15 10 rank higher in the scale than the cre-
ῑ1 3111το power of the poet, the spark from the

1 mind of divinity itself?

The orator might seem 10 afford better
ground for coxnparison, since, though his thea-
tre of action is abroad,he may be said to work
with much the same 10015 35 the writer. Yet
how much of his success depende 011 qualities
other than intellectual! How much depende
on the look, the gesture, the magical tones of
voice, modulated 10 1110 1135510115 110 1135 51111·0(1;
and how much 011 1110 contagious sympathies
of the audience 115011ἱ which drown every thing
like criticism in the overwhehning tide of emo-
tion! If any one would know how much, let
him, after patiently standing

“ till his feet throb,
And his head thumps, to feed upon the breath
Of patriots bursting with heroic rage,''

read the same speech in the columns of a
morning newspaper, or in the well-concocted

1 report of the orator himself.
