Amid all this, in this most cheorless air,
A 1111 where the woodbine 5116115 upon the poroh
Its crinison leaves, as if 1116 year stood there
Firing the ssoor with his inverted toreh—

Amid all this, the cenlre of the scene,
The white-haired matron, with lnonotonons

troad
Plied her swist wheel,an‹l with herjoyless mien
Sat like a fate, and watohed 1116 flying thread.

She had known sorrow. He had walked with
her,
Oft suppod, and brokc with herthe ashen
crust;
And in 1116 dead leaves still 5116 heard 1116 stir
Of his black lna-ntle 1111111613Γ 111 1116 111151.

11Ῑ11116 yet 1161· 6116615 was bright with summer
blooni,
Hor country 511111111611611, 111111 she gave her
all ;

 

THOMAS BUCHANAN READ.

And twice war bowed to her his sable plume—-

Re—gave the swords to rust upon her wall.

Re-gave the swords, but not the hand that drew,

And struck sor liberty the dying blow;

Nor him who, to his sire and country true,

Fen, 'mid the ranks of the invading foe.

Long, but not loud, the droning wheel went on,
Like the low murmur of a hive at noon ;
Long‚ bnt not loud, the memory of the gone
Breathed through her lips a sad and tremu-
lous tone.

And ljgggefieighbors smoothed her careful

ET tho blinded horso go round
Τ111 tho yellow clay be ground,
And 116 woary arms be folded
Till 1116 mass to briek bo 111611111611.

111 116 stately struotures skillcd,
What 1116 temple we would build?
Now the massivo kiln is rison—
Call it palam—eall it prison;
Viow 11 woll: fron] end to ond
Narrow corridors extend
hung, and dark, and sniotlivred aisles:
Choke 115 1“111’1111)ν vanlts with pilos
Of 1116 resinous yellow pino ;
Now thrnst in the fettered Firc—
llearkon! how 116 5111111115 with iro,
Troading out 1116 pitohy wine3
XVrought anon to wilder 5116115,
Hoar him shout his 161111 alarms3
See him thrust his glowing arnis
Through the windows of his 66115.

But his chains at last shall sever;
Slavery lives not forever;

And the thiekest prison wall
Into ruin yet must fall.
XVhatsoever falls away

Springeth up again, they say3

Thon, when this shall break asunder,
And the fire be freed from under,
Tell us what imperial thing

From the ruin shall upspring?

There shall grow a stately building—
Airy dome and eolumned walls;

Mottoes writ in richest gilding
Blazing through its pillared halls.

In those chambers, stern and dreaded‚
They, the mighty ones, shall stand;
There shall sit the hoary-headed
Old defendere of the land.

There shall mighty words be spoken,
Which shall thrill a wondering world;

Thon shall ancient bonds be broken,
And new banners be unfurled.

But anon those glorious uses
In these chambers shall lie dead,
And the world’s antique abuses‚
Hydra-headed, rise instead.

But this wrong not long shall linger-
Τ 116 old capitol must fall;
ι For, behold! the fiery finger
Ι Flames along the fated wall.
