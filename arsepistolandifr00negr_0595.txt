THOMAS HOOD. ζ517

Work-—work—-work

Till the brain begins to swim!
Work—work—work

Till the eyes are heavy and dim !
Seam, and gusset, and band,

Band, and gusset, and seam—
Till over the buttons I fall asleep,

And sew them on in a dream !

O, men, with sisters dear!
O, men, with mothers and wives!
It is not linen you're wearing out,
But human creatures' lives'
Stitch—stitch—stitoh‚
In poverty, hunger, and dirt—
Sewing at once, with a double thread,
A shroud as well as a shirt!

But why do Ι talk of death—
That phantom of grisly bone?

1 hardly fear his terrible shape‚
It seems so like my own—-

It seems so like my own

Because of the fasts I keep ;
O God! that bread should be so dear,

And flesh and blood so cheap!

Work——work—-work 1
My labor never flags ;

And what are its wages? A bed of straw,
A crust of bread—and rags.

That shattered roos—and this naked floor—
A table—a broken chair—

And a wall so blank my shadow I thank
For sometimes falling there!

Work—work—work !

From weary chime to chime!
VVork-—work-work—

As prisoners work for crime!

 

Band, and gusset, and seam,
Seam, and gusset, and band-—

Till the heart is sick and the brain benumbed,
As well as the weary hand.

Work——work—work
In the dull December light!
And work—work—-work‚
When the weather is warm and bright!
While underneath the eaves
The brooding swallows oling,
As if to show 1116 111611· sunny baoks‚
And twit me with the spring.

Oh ! but to breathe the breath
Of the cowslip and primrose 6111661-
With the sky above my head,
And the grass beneath my feet!
For only one short hour
To feel as I used to feel,
Before Ι knew the woes of want,
And the walk that costs a meal!

Oh! but for one short honr—
A respite however brief!

No blessed leisure for love or hope,
But only time for grief!

A little weeping would ease my heart;
But in their briny bed

My tears must stop, for every drop
Hinders needle and thread!

With fingers weary and worn,
And eyelids heavy and red,
A woman sat, in nnwonmnly rags,
Plying her noedle and thread-—
Stitch! stiteh! stite-h !
In poverty, hunger, and dirt;
And still, with a voice ofdolorons 1111011-
Would that its tone could reach the rich 1—
She sang this “Song of the Shirt ! ’'

 

Ι REMEMBER, I REMEMBER.

REMEMBER, I remember,
The house where I was born,
The little window where the sun
Came peeping in at morn ;
Η6 never came a wink too 60011
Nor brought too long 3 day,
But now, Ι often wish the night
Had borne my breath away!

Ι remember, I remember,
The roses, red and white,

The 11101616, and the lily-cups,
Those flowers made of light!

The 111306 where the robin built,
And where my brother set

The laburnnm on his birth-day,—
The tree is living yet!
