Low lies thy love, Lenore!
Come, let the burial rite be read——
The funeral-song be sung !—
Au anthem for the queeuliest dead

That ever died so young-—
A ‹lirge for her, the donbly «lead,
In that she died so young!

‘⁴ lVretches! ye lovml her for her wenlth,
And hateael her for her p1·i‹le;
And when shc'sell in seehle health,
Ye blessed her—that she died ἔ
How shall the ritual, then, he read?
The requiem how he sung
By you—hy yours‚ the evil eye—
By yonrs the simulemus tongue
That did to death the inmwence
That died, and died so young?”

Peccavimus ,·
But rave not thus!
And let a sabbath song [no wrong!
Go up to (ml so solcmnly, the dead may feel
The sweet Lenore
Hath “ gone before.'‘
With hope that ssew beside,
Leaving thee. wild
For the ‹lear child
That should have been thy bride—-

EDGAR ALLAN POE.

For her, the fair
A nd debonair,
That now so lowly lies.
The life upon her yellow hair
But not within her eyes—
The life still there, ¹
Upon her hair—-
The death upon her eyes.

“ A vannt! to-night

My l eart is light
No ‹lirge will Ι upraise‚

But wast the angel on her ssight
With a paean of old days!

Lot ‘no hell toll l—
Lest her sweet soul‚

Amid its hallowed mirth,
Shonld catch the note,

ἵ As it doth float—

Up from the damned earth.
To friends above, from fiends below
The indignant ghost is riven—
From hell unto a high estate
Far up within the heaven—-
From grief and groan,
To a golden throne,
Bcside the King of Heaven.”

THE RAVEN.

No production of Poe‘s so vividly shows his dark. weird, mysterious genius as “The

is Poe's most famous poem, and is enough of itself to perpetuate his fame.

ONCE upon a midnight dreary,

While I 1⁷)ondere‹l‚ weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious
Volume of forgotten lore,
thile I nodded, nearly napping,
Smldenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping,
Rapping at my chamber door.
‘⁸ ’Tis some visitor,'’ Ι mnttered,
“ Tapping at my chamber door-
Only this, and nothing more.''

Ah, distinctly I rcmember,
It was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember

lVrought its ghost upon the floor.

Eagerly I wished the morrow ;

From my books surcease of sorrow-—
Sorrow for the lost Lenore—

For the rare and radiant maiden
thom the angels name Lenore—
N ameless here for evermore.
