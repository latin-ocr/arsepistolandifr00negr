72 FRANCIS BRET HARTE,

notably in “Thankful Blossom'‘—he has produced exquisite romances,
sometimes with a pastoral ssavor, wholly unlike the turbulence of the first
efforts.

The mixture of southern and western people in the early rush to the
gold fields seems to have produced a new dialect, but it probably had a
brief existence. At least, it would be wrong to suppose that the peculiar
phrases in the mining sketches (so picturesque and shocking at once) are
part of the daily tall< of the people to-day. But the dialect was not all.
Harte has described or invented new types of character, and has portrayed
them and their surroundings with a vivid energy that has no modern
counterpart.

It is difficult to say whether he has been more successful in poetry
or in prose3 for the same virile power appears in both, and he has evi-
dently by nature a strong sense of melody and great facility in verse. In
“john Burns of Gettysburg ’' and “ Dickens in Camp '' there is evidence
that he might have taken a higher place among poets if he had devoted
himself to serious work. But 1115 instinct has been his guide‚ and has led
him in the path of fame. lt must be remembered that he acquired the art
of effective writing by practice, without previous discipline, and that for
him there was no model. Since he has shown the way, a number of men
have become celebrated—in the American newspapers—by verses full of
ellipses and eccentricities‚ and with as much of the victorious ease and
dash of Bret Harte as they could borrow.

His Complete Works, collected and revised by himself, appeared in
London in 5 volumes in 1881. Since then his publications have included
“ Flip '³ (1882) 3 “ In the Carquinez Woods '' (1883); “By Shore and
Sedge '' (1885); “ Snowbound at Eagle's '' (1886); “A Phyllis of the 8161·-
1·35,” 311(1 “ A Drift from Redwood Camp '’ (1888); “ Cressy '' and “The
Heritage of Dedlow Marsh, and Other Tales '’ (1889>; “Three Partners,
or The Big Strike on Heavy Tree Hill '³ (1897). Died, May 6, 1902.

 

PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHF'UL JAMES.

HICH I wish to remark— Ah Sin was his name,
v v And my language is plain— And I shall not deny
That for 11315 that are dark‚ In regard to the same
And sor tit-icks that are vain, What that name might imply;
The heathen Chineo 15 peculim, But 1115 5111116 it was pensive and childlike,

Which the same Ι would rise to explain. As I frequent remarked to Bill Nye.
