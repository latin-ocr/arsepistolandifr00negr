HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW. 21

And, as their splendor flashed and failed, Until they made themselves a part
We thought of wrecks upon the main— Of fancies floating through the brain—
Of ships dismasted, that were hailed The long-lost ventures of the heart,
And sent an answer back again. T hat send no answers back again.
The windows, rattling in their frames— O flames that glowedl O hearts that yearned 1
The ocean, roaring up the beach— They were indeed too much akin,
The gusty blast—the bickering flames— The driftwood fire without that burned,
All mingled vaguely in our speech 3 The thoughts that hurned aud glowed within-

THE OPEN WINDOW.

HE old house by the lindens ’ The birds sang in the branchos,
Stood silent in the shade, With sweet, familiar tone;

And on the graveled pathway But the voices of the children,
The light and shadow played. Will be heard in dreams alone!

I saw the nursery windows And the boy that walked beside me,
Wide open to the air; He could not understand

But the faces of the children, Why closer in mine, ah 1 closer,
They were no longer there. Ι pressed his warni, soft hand!

 

THE WREOK OF THE HESPERUS.

The news of a shipwreck off the coast of Massachusetts prompted Mr. Longfellow to
write the following spirited poem. “N01·1nan’s lVoe'' is the name of a dangerous reef.
ξθῐκνρθιι Ἑρ thours of twelve and three one night the poem was written and without any

pparent e or .

T was the schooner Hesperus, The skipper he blew a whiff from his pipe,
l That sailed the wintry sea; [daughter And a scornful laugh laughed he.
And the skipper had taken his little

To bear him company· Colder and louder blew the wind,

A gale from the northeast ;

Blue were her eyes as the fairy flax, The snow fell hissing in the brine,
Her cheeks like the dawn of day ; And the billows frothed like yeast.
And her bosom white as the hawthorn buds, ,

The skipper he stood beside the helm, She shuddered, and paused, like a frightened
With his pipe in his mouth, Then leaped her cable's length.

And watched how the veering flaw did blow

The smoke, now west, now south· “ Come hither, come hither, my little daughter,

And do not tremble so ;
Then up, and spake an old sailor, For Ι can weather the roughest gale
Had sailed the Spanish Main— That ever wind did blow.'’
“ I pray thee, put into yonder port,

For I fear a hurricane He wrapped her warm in his seaman's enat,

Against the stinging blast;
“ Last night the moon had a golden ring, He cut a rope from a broken spar,
And to·night no moon we see‚’' And bound her to the mast.
