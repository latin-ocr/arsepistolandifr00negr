THOMAS CAMPBELL.
Author of the “ Pleasures of Hope,''

 

¹ EST known‚'' says William Allingham‚ “by his remarkable
poem, ‘ The Pleasures of Hope,' Campbell's fame rests upon
., 011161 productioris which do not seem to lose their charm.
ἦ Η6 wrote in the taste of the time, yet with no small degree
of originality‚ and 116 handled topics of immediate though
ephemeral interest. His battle-pieces on names and subj ects
known to all had the true popular ring, a bold tramp of metre.

“ Little matters how Campbell managed to produce his most inspir-

ing poenis, He had the touch, that is what is certain. Many of his
short poems had the unmistakable stamp of the artist upon them. Corn-

pared as lyrical writers, Campbell seems to have a finer touch than Scott
or Byron, the former of whom is apt to be rough, the latter turgid. But
in whatever rank one or another reader may place the poetry of Camp-
bell all will agree that he made genuine additions to English literature.'’
“It is on his lyrics‚’' says Professor Aytoun, “that the future reputation
of Campbell must principally rest. They have taken their place, never
to be disturbed‚ in the popular heart3 and, until the language in which
· they are written perishes‚ they are certain to endure.’'

Thomas Campbell was the youngest of eleven children of a Glasgow
merchant. He was born July 27, 1777, aud received a university educa-
tion. “His Pleasures of Hope‚’' which achieved instant 51166655, gave
him the means to visit the continent and study at Gottingen. He refused
the offer of a chair at Wilna and returned to London‚ where he came near
being arrested as a Jacobite. His “ Exile of Erin‚'' “ Lochiel’s Warn-
ing‚'' and “ Ye Mariners of England '' were well received, but his life was
a constant struggle with poverty, and to support those dependent on him
he compiled articles for the ‘⁴ Edinburgh Encyclopaedia,'' a history of the
reign of George HL, and “ Specimens of the British Poets.'‘

He originated the project of the London University, and was thrice
⁷ elected lord rector of the University of Glasgow. Besides those men-

tioned, Campbell's “ Gertrude of Wyoming ’¹' and “ O'Connor's Child ‘' are
