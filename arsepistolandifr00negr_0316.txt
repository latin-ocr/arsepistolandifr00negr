268 EUGENE FIELD.

fitted for Williams College,but was compelled to give up the idea,
because of failing health. At eighteen he mourned the loss of a loving
father, and one year later returned to the west to reside with his guardian,
Prof. Burgess of Knox College, Galesburg, Ill. Shortly after this Field
was enrolled as a student in the State University at Columbus, Mo.
Here he remained until he was twenty-one years of age. On reaching
his majority, he came into possession of ffi6QOOO, and with a friend im· ι
mediately started for Europe. The result was, that he returned home
bankrupt3 and at once entered into the realms of journalisni. From journ-

alism he developed into the beautiful writer, whom all grew to love and .

His first poem, ⁸‘ Christmas Treasures,’‘ was written simply to fill
an unoccupiecl space in the “ St. Louis Journal.” It is a beautiful little

poem, filled with tender thought :

A little sock, a little toy,
A little look of golden hai r,

The Christmas 11111510 011 the air,
A watching for my baby boy.

But if again that angel train

And golden head come back to 1110,
To bear me to Eternity,

My watching will not be in vain.

In 1883, Mr. Field removed to Chicago, where he became connected
with the “ Daily News.'' He had such a love for children that there were
many homes in Chicago where he was welcomed as a jolly older brother.
No matter what business he had on hand, the children‘s claims always
came first. The story is told that on his wedding day the bride and
guests were waiting, and some of his friends went in search of him.
They found him down 011 1115 knees, in the mud, trying to settle a dis-
pute over marbles with some little street boyS.

The sad note in some of his sweetest songs was caused by the sorrow
attending the death of his own loved 5011. The tender little poem, ζ(0111·

Little Boy Blue‚'' is dedicated to this angel son. The following extract .

from one of his children songs is typical of the man :

Come 111 little people from cot and from hall,

This heart it harh welcome and room for yon all:

Ι will sing you its song and wat-m you with love,

As your dear little arms with my arm intertwine ;

It will roek you away to the dreamland above.

Oh ! ajolly old heau-t is this heart of mine—

And jollier still it is bound to become

XVhen you blow that big trumpet and beat that big drum.
