ELIZABETH OAKES SMITH. 315

A joyous weleome the sunshine gave,
The bird and the swaying tree ;

The spear-like grass and blossoms start
With joy at sight of me.

“ The swallow 6011165 with its bit of clay,
When the busy Spring 15 here.

And twittering bears the moistened gift
A nest on the eaves to 1·61ι1·;

Τ116 twinkling feet of floek and herd
Have trodden a path to me,

And the 1οΧ and the squirrel come to drink
In the sade of the alder-tree.

“ The sunburnt child, with its rounded foot,
Omnes hither with me to play,

And I feel the thrill of 1115 lightsome heart
As he dashes the merry spray.

I turn the mill with answering glee,
As the merry spokes go round,

 

And the gray roek takes the echo up,
Rejoicing 111 the sound.

“ The old man bathes 1115 seattered looks,
And clrops me a silent tear——

For he sees a wriukled, 61116 worn face
Look up from the waters 616111.

Τ11611 Ι sing in 1115 ear the very song
He heard in years gone l)y;

The old man's heart 15 glad again,
And ajoy lights up his eye.”

Enough, enough, thou homily brook !
I’ll treasure thy teachings well,
And Ι will yield a heartfelt tear
Thy crystal drops to swell;
Will bear like thee a kindly love
For the lowly things of earth,
Remembering still that high and pure
Ι5 the home of the spirit's birth.

 

HOBERT’S SEGOND WIFE.
FROM “THE SINLESS ommw

OU speak of Hobert's second wife,
A lofty dame aud bold :
I like not her forbidding air,
And forehead high and eold.
The orphans have no cause for grief,
She dare not give it now,
Though nothing but a ghostly fear
Her heart of pride could bow.

One night the boy his mother called :
They heard him weeping say-

“ Sweet mother, kiss poor Eddy’s eheek,
And wipe his tears away! ''

Red grew the lady's brow with rage,
And yet she feels a strife

Of anger and of terror too,
At thought of that dead wife.

Wild roars the wind, the lights burn blue,
The watch-dog howls with fear;

Loud neighs the steed from out the stall ε
What form 15 gliding near?

No latch 15 raised, no step 15 heard,
But a phantom filis the space—

A sheeted speotre from the dead,
With cold and leaden face!

What 110015 it that no other eye
Beheld the §hade appear?
The guilty lady’s guilty 50111
Β61161(1 it plain and clear!
It slowly glides within the room,
And sadly looks around—
And stoophrg, kissed her daughter’s cheek
With lips that gave 110 50111111 1

ΤΙ1611 softly on the stepdame's arm
She laid a death-oold hand,

Yet it hath seorehed within the flesh
Like to a burning brand ;

And gliding on with 1101561655 foot,
O’er winding stair and hall,

She nears the chamber where 15 heard
Her infant's trembling call.

She smoothed the pillow where he lay,
She warmly tueked the bed,

She wiped 1115 tears, and stroked the curls
That clustered round his head.

The child, earessed, unknowing sear,
Hath nestled him to rest;

The mother folds her wings beside—
The mother from the blest!
