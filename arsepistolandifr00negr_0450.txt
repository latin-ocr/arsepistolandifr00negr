ψ they are such as might have been. In a profonnd sense, there-
fore, the tale is true, and there are novelists of higher repnte
who have constantly endeavored to impart moral lessons to
their readers and noble rnles of conduct. Mr. Roe is one of these. He
is not a Dickens‚ or Irving‚ or Warner‚ or Howells‚ or “Grace Green-
wood‚’' bnt his works have been very popular, one reason of which is dne
to their decided moral tone. ⁴·No religions instinct, no requisite of good

Mr. Roe was born at New Windsor, N. Y„ in 1838. He pursned
his studies at Williams College, Massachnsetts‚ bnt owing to impaired
eyesight was not able to graduate. He entered the ministry of the Pres-
byterian Chnrch‚ and from 1865 to 1874 was a pastor at Highland Falls‚
N. Y. Previous to this he served as chaplain in the Federal army
throughout the Civil War. His distinction as an author was such that
after a number of years Williams College conferred upon him the degree
of A. B.

In 1871 occurred the great Chicago fire. Mr. Roe seized upon this
tragic event as the subject for his first novel, which was entitled “ Barriers
Burned Away.’' Its success was immediate, and it has been stated by
competent critics that it contains perhaps the most accurate description
of the terrible conflagration that has ever been pnblished. The author
pictures the frightful scenes vividly and enthralls the attention of the
reader with his graphic portrayal of the appalling catastrophe.

After 1874 Mr. Roe devoted himself almost entirely to literary work

  

np to the time of his death, which occurred at Cornwall, N. Y„ in 1888. .
He was 3 good deal of an agriculturist and employed his leisnre time on ‹
a small fruit farm in the cultivation of garden produce for the market. ἶ
