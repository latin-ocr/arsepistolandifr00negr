EDGAR ALLAN POE. 59

and persuaded General Poe, his grandfather, to suffer him to adopt him.
He was brought up in Mr. Allan’s family, and as that gentleman had
no other children, he was regarded as his 5011 and heir. In 1816 116
accompanied Mr. and Μ15. Α11311 10 Great Britain, visited every portion
of it, and afterward passed four or five years 111 3 school kept at Stoke
Newington, near London, by the Reverend Doctor Bransby. He returned
to America in 1822, and in 1825 went to the Jefferson University, at
Charlottesville, in Virginia, where he led a very dissipated life, the manners
of the college being at that time extremely dissolute. He took the first
honors, however, and went home greatly 111 debt.

Mr. Allan refused to pay some of his debts and he hastily quitted the
country on a Quixotic expedition to join the Greeks, then struggling for
liberty. He did not reach his original destination, however, but made his
way to St. Petersburg, in Russia, where he became involved in difficulties
from which he was extricated by Mr. Henry Middleton‚ the American
minister at that capital. He returned home in 1829, and immediately
afterward entered the military academy at West Point.

In about eighteen months from that time, Mr. Allan, who had lost
his first wife while Mr. Poe was in Russia, married again. He was sixty-
five years of age, and the lady was young3 Poe quarrelled with her, and
the veteran husband, taking the part of his wife addressed him an angry
letter, which was answered in the same spirit. Mr. Allan died soon after,
leaving an infant son the heir to his property, and bequeathed Poe
nothing.

The army, in the opinion of the young cadet, was not a place for a
poor man, so 116 left West Point abruptly, and determined to maintain
himself by authorship. He had printed, while in the military academy,
a small volume of poemS, most of which were written in early youth. They
illustrated the character of his abilsties, and justified 1115 anticipations of
success. For a considerable time, however, his writings attracted but
little attention. At length, in 1831, the proprietor of a weekly literary
gazette in Baltimore offered two premiums, one for the best story in prose,
and the other for the best poem. In due time our author sent in two
articles, both of which were successful with the examining committee, and
popular upon their appearance before the public. '

Mr. Thomas W. White had then recently established ‘⁴ The South-
ern Literary Messenger,’‘ at Richmond, and upon the warm recommenda-
tion of a member of the committee that has been referred to, Mr. Poe was
