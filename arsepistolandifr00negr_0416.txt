r? ‚ i R. ADAMS had a gift in one line of authorship. Of the hun-

¹ drcd volumes he published, all, with two or three exceptions,
were written for young people. Each narrative was well

the work (lid uot realize the author’s aim and intention. He
meant to both entertain and instruct his multitude of young readers, and
the high moral tone and wholesome influence of his works have never
been questioned.

stories and sketches for papers and periodicals, all of which bore the im-
press of 1115 ]166111131 gifts and genius as a story teller.

ward conducted ‘⁴ Oliver Optic’s Magazine for Boys and Girls.’' His

already gained
