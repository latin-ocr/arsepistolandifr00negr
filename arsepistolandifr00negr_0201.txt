JAMES A. GARFIELD. 155

of September. His assassin was tried, and executed at Washington,
3 June 30, 1882.

, Mr. Garfield was master of a free, vigorous, commanding style of
Ϊ or'atory. He always spoke as a man to men. The extract we here furnish
¹ from his speeches is au excellent specimen of his thought and verbal
2 expression. It was greeted with enthusiasm by one of our great national
, conventions. The cast of Mr. Garfield's mind was somewhat similar to
³ that of his friend and ardent admirer, James G. Blaine. The two men
J were alike 111 practica] thinking, always aiming at something substantial
ἰ 111 distinction from the superficial, yet gifted with sufficient imagination
= and enough of the poetic temperament to render their orations and
speeches remarkably attractive. Both were superbly endowed,intellect-
ε ually, and were among the giants of the Republic.

Mr. Garfield, then a man comparatively unknown, was in New York
, City when news was received of the assassination of President Lincoln in
³ 1865. Crowds of people were on the streets. He addressed impromptu
ἶ 3 throng in Wall street, and closed with the statement so often quoted,
, “ God reigns, and the Government at Washington still lives.''

 

THE SOURGE OF· PARTY WISDOM.

HAVE seen the sea lashed into fury and
tossed into spray, and its grandeur moves
the soul of the dullest man ; but Ι 161116111-

ἶ ber that it is not the billows‚ but the calm

level of the sea, from which all heights and

ς depths are measured. When the storm has

passed and the hour of calm settles on the

ocean, when 1116 sunlight bathes its smooth

Q surface, then the astronomer and surveyor

, take the level from which to measure all

j terrestrial heights and depths.

ς Gentlemen of the convention, your present

Ῐ temper may 1101 mark the healthful pulse of

our people when our enthusiasm 1135 passed.

ξ When the emotions of this hour have sub-

]’ sided we shall find 11131 631111 level of public

,- opinion below the storm, from which the

where fifteen thousand men and women are
assembled, is the destiny of the Republican
party to be declared.

Not here, where I see the faces of seven
hundred and fifty-six delegatos waiting 10
6351 their votes in the 0111 311(1 determine the
choice of the republic, but by four million
Republican thesides, where the thoughtful
voters, with wives and children about them,
with the calm thoughts inspired by the love
of home and country, with the history of the
past, the hopes of the future, and 3 knowh (lge
of the great men who have adorned and
blessed our 11311011 111 days gone by—there
God prepares the verdiet that shall determine
the wisdom of our work to-night. Not in
Chicago, in the heats of June, but in the

thoughts of a mighty people are 10 be meas· sober quiet that comes to them between now
' ured, and by which their final action will be and November; in the silence of deliberate
. determined. Not here in this brilliant circle, judgment will the great question be settled.
