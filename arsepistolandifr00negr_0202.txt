Eminent H istorian.

1} η R. PRESCOTT was born at Salem, Massachusetts‚ May 4, 17·
of parents who were remarkable for their high moral qu. .‚
, ⁴ ties. When fifteen years old he entered the Sophomore cl..÷—;
² Α of Harvard College. An unfortunate accident occurred duri e:-
his Junior year which permanently inj ured his sight. Duris ’

weeks was able to resume his studies. The sight of the injured eye w -.
however, gone forever. ¹

Ticknor thus comments on Mr. Prescott's resolve to pursue a litera

 

career:

seldom wholly free—should, at the age of five and twenty or thi >

happened in times ancl countries far distant from his own, and that e J
recorded chiefly in foreign languages and by authors whose conflicti-¹ ’
testimony was often to be reconciled by laborious comparison, is

remarkable fact in literary history. It is a problem the solution s ·
which was, Ι believe, never before undertaken3 certainly never befrss ,

accomplished. Nor do I conceive that he himself could have acco·
plished it, unless to his uncommon intellectual gifts had been addg ”·
great animal spirits, a strong, persistent will, and a moral cou 2. .

that was to be daunted by no obstacle that he might deem it possible Δ 4
