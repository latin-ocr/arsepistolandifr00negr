GEoRoE PERKle Momm.
Renowned Lyric Poet.

OPULAR as a song-writer, an author of unsullied taste‚ pure

and deep feeling, issuing such productions as charm the
,ᾗ average reader, Mr. Morris gained enviable distinction and
must be considered as worthy of high rank. His well-known
poem, “XVoedman, Spare That Tree‚’' is enough of itself to
perpetuate his name, while another entitled‚ “ My Mother's
Bible‚’' is no less charming and no less worthy to live in the hearts and
homes of the people. One secret of his popularity was the selection of
subj ects that lie near to the heart of the average, thoughtful reader, thus
enlisting his sympathies.

Mr. Morris was born in Philadelphia in 1802. He became associate
editor of the “ New York Mirror '’ in 1823, and in 1844 one of the editors
of “The Evening Mirror,'' aliterary journal. The old famous “Home
Journal,'' which had such a popular career and was really possessed of
unusual inerit, was founded by Mr. Morris in connection with N. P.

Willis. This publication first saw the light in 1846, and the ability with
· which it was conducted is a matter of literary history. Conjointly with
Mr. Willis, a volume was issued by Mr. Morris entitled‚ “The Prose
and Poetry of Europe and America.'' Mr. Morris is the author of one

drama, “ Briercliff,'' and of poems which have had a wide circulation.
He died in New York in 1864.

 

MY MOTHER‘S BIBLE.
HIS book is all that’s left me now— Ah 1 well do I remember those

Tears will unbidden start— Whose names these records bear 3
With faltering lip and throbbing brow Who round the hearthstone used to close,
I press it to my heart. Aster the evening prayer,
For many generations past And speak of what these pages said
Here is our family tree3 In tones my heart would thrill 1
My mother’s hands this Bible elasped, ἱ Though they are with the silent dead

She, dying, gave it me. Here are they living still Ι
