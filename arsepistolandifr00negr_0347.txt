WILL CARLETON.

And one thing put in the paper, that first to
me didn't occur ;

That when Ι am dead at last she will bring
me back to her,

And lay me under the maple wc planted years
a o,

Whengshe and Ι was happy, before we quar-
reled 50.

And when she (1165, I wish that she would be
laid by 1116;

And lyin' together in silence, perhaps we’ll
then agree;

And if ever we meet in heaven, Ι wouldn't
think it queer

If we loved each other the better because we've
quarreled here.

LITTLE GOLDEN-HAIR.

ITTLE Golden-hair was watching‚ in the
L window broad and high,
For the coming of her father, who had
gone the foe to fight ;
He had left her in the morning, and had told
her not to cry,
But to have a kiss all ready when he came
to her at night.

She had wandered, all the day,

In her simple childish way,

And had asked, as time went on,
WVhere her father could have gone.

She had heard the muskets firing, she had
counted every one,
Till the number grew so many that it was
too great a load;
Then the evening fell upon her, clear of sound
01 51101 01 gun,
And she gazed with wistful waiting down
the dusty Concord road.

Little Golden-hair had listened, not a single
week before,
While the heavy sand was falling 011 her
mother's coffin-lid3
And she loved her father better for the loss
that then she bore,
And thought of him and yearned for him, ¹
whatever else she did.

So she wondered all the day
What could make her father stay,
And. she cried a little too,

As he told her not to do.

And the sun sunk slowly downward and went
grandly out of sight,
And she had the kis 55 all ready on 1115 lips,¹

to be bestowed3 1

 

But the shadows made one shadow‚ and the
twilight grew to night,
And she looked, and looked, and listened,
down the dusty Concord road.

Then the night grew light and lighter, and
the moon rose full and round,
In the little sad face peering, looking pite-
ously and mild,
Still upon the walks of gravel there was
heard no welcome sound,

And no father came there, eager for the kisses
of his child.

Long and sadly did she wait,
Listening at the cottage-gate;
Then she felt a quick alarm‚

Lest he might have come to harm.

With no bonnet but her tresses, no compan-
ion but her fears,
And no guide except the moonbeams that
the pathway dimly showed‚
With a little sob of sorrow, quick 5116 threw
away her tears,
And alone she bravely started down the
dusty Concord road,

And for many a mile she struggled, full of
weariness and pain,
Calling loudly for her father, that her voice
he might not miss ;
Till at last, among the number of the wounded
and the slain,
Was the white face of the soldier, waiting
for his daughter's kiss.

Softly to his lips she crept,

Not to wake him as he slept;

Then, with her young heart at rest,
Laid her head upon his breast.
