BAYARD TAYLOR.

There’s a magical isle up the river Time,
Where the softest of airs are playing‚
There’s a cloudless sky and a tropical clime,
And a song as sweet as a vesper chime,
And the J unes-with the roses a're straying,

And the name of this isle is the “ Long Ag0.''
And we bury our treasures there3

There are brows of beauty and bosoms of snow,

There are heaps of dust—-ohl we loved them 50--
There are trinkets and tresses of hair.

,There are fragments of son gs that nobody sings.
There are parts of an infant's prayer,

There’s a lute unswept and a harp without And our eyes are closing in slumbers a while.

strings,

There are broken vows and pieees of rings‚

And the garments our loved used to wear.

There are hands that are waved when the fairy

By thesfililtz'iii mirage is lifted in air,

When the wind down the river was fair.

Oh 1 remembered for aye be that blessed isle,

All the day of our life until night:

And when evening glows with its beautiful

smile,

May a lovelier isle be in sight.

 

THE SONG OF THE GAMP.

C C IVE us a song! '’ the soldicrs cried‚
G The outer trenches gum-(ling,
then the heated guns of the cumps
allied

Grew weary of bombarding.

The dark Redan, in silent scoff,
Lay grim and threatening under ;
And the tawny mound of the Malakoff
No longer belched its thunder.

’ There was a pause. A guardsman said :
“We storm the forts to-morrow ;
Sing while we may, another day
“· Will bring enough of sorrow.⁷'

They lay along the battery’s side,
Below the smoking eannon ;
Brave hearts from Severn and from Clyde,

And from the banks of Shanuon.

They sang of love, and not of fame ;
Forgot was Britain's glory:

Eaeh beart recalled a different name,
But all sang “ Annie Laurie.''

Voice after voice caught up the song,
Until its tender passion

 

Rose like an anthem, rich and strong-—
Their battle-eve confession.

Dear girl, her name he dared not speak,
But as the song grew leude-r,

Something upon the soldier's eheek
XVashed off the stains of powder.

sseyond tho clarkening ocean burned
The hloody sunset's emhers,

While the Crimean valleys learned
How English love remembers.

And once again a fire of hell
Rained on the Russian quarters,
With seream of shot, and burst of shell
And bellowing of the mortars!

And Irish Nora's eyes are dim
For a singer <lumb and gory ;
And English Mary mourus for him
Who sang of “ Annie Laurie.'’

Sleep‚ soldiers 1- still in honored rest
Your truth and valor wearing3

The bravest are the tenderest—
The loving are the daring.

Sweet voices we heard in the days gone before,
