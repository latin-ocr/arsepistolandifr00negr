JOHN BARTHOLOMEW Gomon.

Renowned Lecturer and Orator.

J A ί ONDERFUL dramatic power, great humor and pathos, were
μ ¹* ’ζ’ the distinguishing features of Mr. Gough’s unrivalled oratory.
xx ᾗ, 4. As forests are swayed by winds, so he moved the hearts of
’ζ ‘ ’ his audiences, at one timc amusing his hearers to the highest
pitch of enthusiasm, and again melting them to tears, or con-
vulsing them with laughter.

Mr. Gough was born at Sandgate, Kent, England, August 22, 1817.
His father was a pensioner of the Peninsular war, his mother a village
schoolmistress. When very young he came with his mother and sister
to New York, and soon after this his mother died. He worked for a while
on a farm in Oneida County, N. Y„ and then went to New York City
and learned the trade of a bookbinder. His habits of dissipation lost him
his employment, and for 3 time he subsisted by giving recitations and
singing comic songs at low grog shops. He was married in 18393 but
his drunken habits reduced him to poverty and delirium tremens, and
probably caused the death of his wife and child.

He drifted to VVorcester, Mass, and there one day while he was drunk
in the gutter Joel Stratton, a name ever to be remembered, lifted him up,
kindly cased for him, induced him to sign the temperance pledge, and
saved to the world its most eloquent advocate of the cause of temperance.
Resolving to devote the remainder of his life to the temperance work, he
began lecturing, suddenly sprang into extraordinary popularity, lectured
with great pathos, humor and earnestness in various parts of America,
aud drew immense audiences wherever he went.v

In 1853 he was engaged by the London Temperance League, and
lectured for two years in the United Kingclom, where he attracted large

crowds to his meetings. He was again in England in 1857-60 and 1878.
It is said that he lectured more than one hundred times in Exeter Hall,

London, and never failed of having a large audience. In some of his
later addresses he took up literary and socia] topics, such as “Low Life
in London,'' “Here and There in Britain,'' etc.
