ALICE AND PHOERE CARY. 207
MAKE BELIEVE.

ISS me, though you make believe; Ι should feel and almost know
Kiss me, though I almost know You are trifling with my wop„
You are kissing to deceive:
Lef‘ the nde ‘one’ moment flOW VVhisper to me sweet and low;
Basskward ere η, mf’e and break’ Tell me how you sit and weave
only for POOl' Plty S sake! Droams about me, though I know

It is only make believe!
Just a moment, though 'tis plain
You are jesting with my pain.

Give me of your flowers one leaf,
Give me of your smiles one smile,

Baokward roll this tide of grief
Just a moment, though, the while, ALICE CARY,

 

A SPINSTER’ S STINT.

IX skeins and three, six skeins and three! Ι One, two, three stars along the skies
GOOd mother, SO yOU Stin-ted me, Begin to wink their golden eyes,—
And here they be›—sty› SlX and three! I’ll leave my thread all knots and ties.

Stop, busy wheel! stop, noisy wheel!
Long shadows down my chamber steaI, Ο moon, SO red! Ο moon, so red Ῐ
And wal-11 me to make haste and reel. Sweefflleffl't Of ssight, gO straight tO bed 3

' ο . . Love’s light will answer in your stead.
T 1s done‚——the spmnmg work complete,

Ο heart of mine, what makes you beat

So fast and sweet, so fast and sweet. A-tiptoe‚ bGCkOUing me, he stands,-
· . Stop trembling, little foolish hands,
{imum have Whffaf' and, pmks' tf) Stmk And stop the bands, and stop the hands!
y hat from brim to ribbon, th1ck‚—
Slow hands of mine, be quiek, be quick! Amor: CARY.

 

A DYING· HYMN.

The last stanza oomposed by Aliee Cary, was written on her death-bed, with trembling
hand, the pen falling from her fingers as the ohill of death was stealing over her. The stanza

was thls ’ «ι As the poor panting hart to the water-brook runs-

As the water-brook runs to the sea-—
So earth’s sainting daughters and famishing sons,
Oh, fountain of love, run to Thee.'’

Then, with her last breath, she repeated the following, written some years before, as if
prophetie of her last hour:

ARTH with its dark and dreadful ills The shadows that I feared so long,
Recedes‚ and fades away ; Are all alive with light.
Lift up your heads, ye heavenly hills! ·
Ye gates Of death, give way! The while my pulses faintly beat,
My faith doth so almund,
My soul is full of whispered song3 I feel grow firm beneath my feet

My blindness is my sight3 The green immortal ground.
