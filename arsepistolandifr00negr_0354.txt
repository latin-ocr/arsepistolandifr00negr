on the men; our regimental toast on the
transport running: “The officers: may the
war last until each is killed, wounded or

promoted. ''
As O'Neill movcd to and fro, his men

begged him to lie down, and 6116 of the ser-
geants said: “Captain, a bullet is sure to
hit you.'’ O’Neill took his cigarette out of
his mouth and blowing out a cloud of smoke,
laughed and said: “Sergeant, the Spanish
bullet isn't made that will kill me.'’ A little
later 116 discussed for a moment with one of
the regular Officers the direction from which
a Spanish fire was coming. As he turned on
his heel a bullet struck him in the mouth and
came out at the back of his head; so that
even before he fell his wild and gallant soul
had gone out into the darkness.

My orderly was a brave young Harvard
boy, Sanders, from the quaint old Massachu-
setts town of Salem. The work of an orderly
on foot, under the blazing sun, through the
hot and matted jungles, was very severe and
finally the heat overcame him. He dropped ;
nor did he ever recover fully, and later he
died from fcver. In his place I summoned a
trooper whose name Ι did not know. Shortlv
afterwanl, while sitting beside the bank, Ι
directed him to go back and ask whatever
general he came across if I could not advance,
as myrnen were being much cut up. He stood
up to salute and then pitched forward across
my knees, a bullet having gone through his
throat, cutting the carotid.

THEODORE ROOSEVELT.

When O'Nell was shot, his troop, who were
devoted 16 him, were for the moment at 6 loss
who to sollow. One of their number, Henry
Bardshar, a huge Arizona miner‚ immediately
attached himself to me as my orderly, and
from that moment he was closer to me, not
only 111 1116 fight, but throughout the rest 61
1116 campaign, than any other man, not even
excepting the color sergeant, Wright.

[Colonel Roosevelt artem-ward received 1116 order to ad·
vance, and continues his graphio narrative, as follows :]

A curious incident occurred as Ι was get-
ting the 111611 started forward. Always when
111611 have boen lying down under cover for
some time and are required to advance, there
is a little hesitation, each looking to see
whether the others are going forward. As I
rode down the line calling to 1116 troopers to
go forward, and rasping brief directions to
1116 captains and lieutenants, I came upon a
man lying behind a little bush, and ordered
him to jump up.

I do 1161 think he understood that we were
making a forward move, and he looked up at
me for a moment with hesitation ; and I again
hade him rise, jeering him and sayingt ‘¹ Are
you afraid to stand up when Ι am on horse·
back? ” As Ι spoke he suddenly fell forward
on his face, a bullet having struck him and
gone through him lengthwise. I suppose the
bullet had been aimed at 1116 ; 61 any rate, Ι,
who was on horseback in the open, was unhurt,
and the man lying flat on the ground in the
cover beside me, was killed.

EULOGY ΟΝ PRESIDENT McKINLEY.

ΙΤ is not too much to say that at the time of united the tender affections and home virtues
President McKinley’s death he was the which are all important in the makeup of

most widely loved man in all the United
States, while we have never had any public
man of his position who had been so wholly
free from the bitter animosities incident to
public life. His political opponents were the
first to hear the heartiest and most generous
tribute to the broad kindliness of nature, the
sweetness and gentleness of character which
so endeared him to his close associates. To a
standard of lofty integrity in public life he

national character. A gallant soldier in the
great war for the Union, he also shone as an
example to all our people because of his con-
duct in the most sacred and intimate of home
relations

Wealth was not struck at when the Presi-
dent was assassinated, but the honest toil
which is content with moderate gains aster 6
lifetime of unremitting labor, largely in the
service of the public.
