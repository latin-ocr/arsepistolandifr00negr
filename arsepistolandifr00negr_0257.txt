ALlCE AND PHOEBE CARY.

Suppose the world ‹loesn't plrase you,
Nor the way some people do,—

Do you think the whole creation
Will be altered just for you?

And isn't it, my boy or girl,
The wisest, bravest plan,

Whatever eomes or doesn't come
To do the best you can?

PHOEBE CARY.

 

GONE BEFORE.

, F still they kept their earthly place,
The friends I held in my embrace,
And gave to death, alas!
Gould Ι have learned that clear, calm faith
That looks beyond the bounds of death,
And almost longs to pass?

Sometimes I think, the things we see
Are shadows of the things to be ;

That what we plan we build ;
That every hope that hath been crossed,

And every dream we thought was lost,
In heaven shall be fulfilled ;

That even the children of the brain
Have not been born and died in vain,
Though here unclothed and dumb!
But 011 some brighter, better shore,
They live, embodied evermore,
And wait for us to come.

And when on that last day we rise,
Caught up between the earth and skies,

Then shall we hear our Lord
Say, Thou hast done with doubt and death,
Henceforth, according to thy faith,

Shall be thy faith's reward.

PHOEBE CARY.

THE GHIOKEN‘S MIS'I'AKE.

LITTLE downy chick one day
Asked leave to go 011 the water,

Where she saw a duck with her brood at

play

Swimming and splashing about her.

Indeed, she began to peep and cry,
When her mother wouldn't let her,

“ If the ducks can swim‚ theu why can't I?
Are they any bigger or better? '²

Then the old hen answered, “ Listen to me,
And hush your foolish talking ;

Just look at your feet, and then you will see
They were only made for walking.'’

But chieky wistfully eyed the brock,
And (lidn’t half believe 1101·;

For she seemed to say, by a knowing look,
Such stories couldn’t deceive her.

“1 know I can go there and not be drowned,
And so Ι think I’ll show her.''

T hen she made a plunge where the stream was
Andigixlrj'too late her blunder ;

For she had hardly time to peep
then her foolish head went under.

And now I hope her fate will show
That child my story reading,

That those who are older sometimes know
that you will do well 111 heeding :

That each content 111 his place should dwell,
And envy not his brother,

For any part that is acted well
Is just as good as another;

For we all have our proper spheres below,
And this is a truth worth knowing:

And as her mother was scratching the ground, You will come to grief if you try to go

She muttered lower and lower,

14

WVhere you never were made for going.
PHOEBE CARY.
