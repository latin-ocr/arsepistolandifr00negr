How could Ι refuso? I ran and soon brought
a kettleful. “ I am sure,'’ continued he, “ you
are one of the finest lads that ever Ι have
seen ; will you just turn a few minutes for me ?‘'

Pleased with the flattery, Ι went to work;
and I toiled and tugged till Ι was almost tired
to death. The school-bell rang, and I could
not get away; my hands were hlistered, and
the ax was not half ground.

At length, however, it 11113 sharpeued ; and
the man turned 10 1116 with, ‘¹ Now, you little
raseal, you've played truant : 116 off 10 school,
or you'll rue it ! ''

“Alas! '' thought I, “it is hard enough to

THE FARMER’ S WIFE.

HE fax-mer came in from the field 01161111)ν ;
His languid step and his weary way,
His bended brmv, his sinewy hand, ⁷
All shewed his work for the good of the land ;
For he sows,
And he 11063,
And he 1110113,
All for the good of the land.

By the kitchen fire stood his patient wife,
Light of 1113 1101116 andjoy of his life,
With face all aglow and busy hand,
Preparing the meal for her husband's band ;

For she must boil,

And she must broil‚

And she must 1011,

All for the good of the home.

The bright 31111 31111163 when the farmer goes
out, ’
The birds sing sweet songs, lambs frisk about
The brook babbles softly 111 1116 glen,
While he works 30 bravely for the good of 111611;
For 116 30113,
And 116 1110113,

And he 11063,
All for the good of the laud.

How briskly the wife steps about within,

The dishes to wash, the milk to skim ;

The fire goe-s out, flies buzz about—-

For the dear ones at home her heart is kept
There are pies to make, [stout ;
There 13 bread to bake,
And steps to take,

All sor the sake of 1101116.

· 11711611 1116 day is o'er, and the evening is come
¹ The creatures are fed, 1116 milking done,
ἶ He takes his rest ’neath the o'ld shade tree,

From the labor of the land his thoughts are
free :
T hough he sows,
And he hoes,
And he mows,
He rests from the work of the land.

But the faithful wife, from sun to sun,
Takes her burden up that's never done :
There 13 110 1631, 111616 13 110 play,
For the good of the house she must work away;
For to mend the frock,
And to knit the sock,
And the cradle to rock,
All for the good of the home.

WVhen autumn 13 11616, and 113 ehilling hlast,
The fai-mer gathers his erop at last;
His barns are full, 1113 fields are bare,

For the good of the land he ne'er hath care,
While it blows,

 

And it SssOWS,
Till winter goes,
He rests from the work of the land0

But the willing wife, till life's elosing day,
Is the children's guide, the husband's stay ;
From day to day she has done her best,
Until death alone ean give her rest, .
For after the test,
Comes the rest,

With the blest‚
In the fai-mer’s heavenly home.
