196 JAMES THOMAS FIELDS.

‘¹ Now Ι am old, and blind, and lame,
They've turned me out to die alone,
Without a shelter for my head,
Without a serap of bread or bone.

“ This morning Ι can hardly crawl,
While shivering in the snow and hail,
My teeth are dropping one by one ;
I scaree have strength to wag my tail ;

“I’m palsied grown with mortal pains,
My withered limbs are useless n0w;
My voice is almost gone, you see,
And I can hardly make my bow.

“ Perhaps you’ll lead me to a shed
Where I may find some friendly straw
On which to lay my aehing limbs,
And rest my helpless broken paw.

“ Strangen excuse this story long,
And pardon, pray, my last appeal;
You've owned a dog yourself, perhaps,
And learned that dogs, like men, canfeel.”

Yes, poor old Rover, come with me;

Food, with warm shelter, I'll supply—
And heaven forg1ve the cruel souls

tho drove you forth to starve and die! ·

 

LAST WISHES OF A GHILD.

C ί LL the hedges are in bloom,
And the warm west wind is blowing‚
Let me leave this stifled room—
Let me go where flowers are growing.

“ Look! my cheek is thin and pale,
And my pulse is very low ;
Ere my sight begins to fail,
Mother dear, you’ll let me go ;

‘¹ lVas not that the robin's song
Piping through the casement wide?
I shall not be listening long—
Take me to the meadow-side!

‘⁶ Bear me to the willow-brook—
Let me hear the merry mill—
On the orchard I must look,
Ere my beating heart is still.

‘¹ Faint and fainter grows my breath—
Bear me quiekly down the lane;

Mother dear, this ohill is death—
Ι shall never speak again l ’'

Still the hedges are in bloom,

And the warm west wind is blowing;
Still we sit in silent gloom—

O'er her grave the grass is growing.

 

SLEIGHING-SONG.

H swift we go, o’er the fleeoy snow,
O When moonbeams sparkle round ;

With a laugh and song, we glide along
Across the fleeting snow ;

When hoofs keep time to musie’s chime. With friends beside, how swift we ride

As merrily on we bound.

On a winter’s night, when hearts are light,
And health is on the wind,

We loose the rein and sweep the plain,
And leave our cares behind.

On the beautiful traek below!

Oh, the raging sea has joy for me,
When gale and tempests roar;

But give me the speed of a foaming steed‚
And I'll ask for the waves no more.
