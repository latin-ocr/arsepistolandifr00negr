κ known by his notes of trave] and society sketches than by =
those char-ming poems on biblical subjects which have handed Ἰ
1115 1131110 down to the present generation. Willis' “Sacred
Poenis '³ have long been favorites with the more thoughtful
and devout of the reading public.
Nathanicl P. Willis was born at Portland, in Maine, on the twentieth
day of January, 1807. During his childhood his parents removed to Bos· ,
ton 3 and at the Latin school in that city, and at the Philips Academy in
Anclover, he pursued his studies until he entered Yale College‚ in 1823.
While he resided at New Haven‚ as 3 student, he won a high reputation,
sor so young an author, by a series of “ Scripture Sketches,'' and a few
other brief poems3 and it is supposed that the 11731111 and too indiscrimi-
nate praises bestowed upon these productions, influenced unfavorably his
subsequent progress in the poetic art.
He was graduated in 1827, and in the following year he published a ’
“ Poeni delivered before the Society of United Brothers of Brown Univer-
sity,’' which, as well 35 1115 “ Sketches,'' issued soon after he lest college,
