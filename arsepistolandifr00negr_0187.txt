HORACE GREELEY.

His advice was followed by many who became prominent in every walk
of life and filled positions of usefulness.

In 1872 occurred a surprise in politics.
for the Presidency by Liberal Republicans and bolting Democrats.

Mr. Greeley was nominated
He

went heart and soul into the campaign, but although fondly hoping for
success, he was overwhelmingly defeated. About this time his wife died,
a great blow for him, and his own death, from inflammation of the brain,

occurred November 29, 1 8 7 2.

THE GREAT SENATORS.

UR great triumvirate-—Clajg ‘Websten l

Calhoun-—last appeared together in

public life in the Senate of 1849-50;
the two former figuring conspicuously iu the
‹lebates which preluded aud resulted in what
was termed the Compromise of that year——
Mr. Calhoun dying as they had fairly opened,
and Messrs. Clay and VVebster not long aster
their close. These lines are, therefore, in some
sort, my humble tribute to their genius and
their just renown.

I best knew and loved Henry Clay3 lie was
by nature geni-al, cordial, courteous, gracious,
magnetic, winning. XVhen General Glaseoek,
of Georgia, took his seat in Congress as a
Representative, a mutual friend asked‚ “ Gen-
eral, may I introduce you to Henry Clay?”
“No, sir 1 ’' was the stern response3 “ I arn his
adversary, and choose not to subject myself to
his fascination.’' Ι think it would have been
hard to constitute for three or four years a
legislative body whereof Mr. Clay was a
member, and not more than four-sevenths
were his pledged, implacable opponents,
whereof he would not have been the master-
spirit, and the author and inspirer of most of
its measures, after the first or second year.

Mr. VVebster was colder, graver, sterner, in
his general bearing: though he could unbend
and be snnny and blithe in his intercourse
with those admitted to his intimacy. There
were few gayer or more valued associates on a
fishing or sailing party. His mental calibre

-was much the larger3 I judge that he had
read and studied more; though neither could
boast much erudition‚ not even intense appli-
cation. I believe each was about thirty years

 

in Congress, where Mr. Clay identified his
name with the origin or success of at least half
a dozen important measures to every one thus
blended with Mr. WVebster's. Though Web-
ster's was far the more massive intellect, Mr.
Clay as a legislator evinced far the greater
creative, constructive power.

Ι once sat iu the Senate Chamber when Mr.
Douglas, who had just been transferred from
the Home, rose to move forward a bill in
which he was interested. ‘¹ We have no such
practice in the Senate, sir,'’ said Mr. XVebster,
in his deep, solemn voice, fixing his eye ou the
mover, but without rising from his seat. Mr.
Douglas at once varied his motion, seeking to
achieve his end in a somewhat different way.
“That is not the way we do business in the
Senate, sir,'’ rejoined Mr. Webster, still more
decisively and sternly. “The Little Giant ’'
was a bold, ready man, not easily overawed
or disconcerted; but, if he did not quiver
under the eye and voice of XVebsten then my
eyesight deceived me—and Ι was very near
him.

Mr. Calhoun was a tall, spare, earnest, evi-
dently thoughtful man, with stiff, iron-gray
hair, which reminded you of Jackson's about
the time of his accession to the Presidency.
He was eminently a logician—terse, vigor-ons,
relentless. He courted the society of elever,
aspiring young men who inclined to fall into
his views, and exerted great influence over
them. As he had abandoned the political
saith which Ι distinguish and cherish as
National while I was yet a school-boy, I never
met him at all intimately; yet once, while I
was connected with mining on Lake Superior,
