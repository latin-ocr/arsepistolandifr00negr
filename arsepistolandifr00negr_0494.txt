Then off he went to Canada‚
N ext to Ticonderoga,

And quitting those, away 110 goes,
Straightway 10 Saratoga.

With great parade his march 110 made,
To gain his wished-for-station,

then far and wide his ininions hied,
To spread 1113 “ Proclamation.'’

To such as stayed 110 offers made,
Of “pardon on subinissi0n3

But savage bands should waste the lands
Of all in opposition.”

But ah, the crue] fate of war
This boasted sou of Britain,
then mounting his triumphal car,
With sudden sear was smitten.

FAVORITE POEMS AND PROSE SELECTIONS.

The sons of freedom gathered round,
His hostile bands confounded,

And when they’d fain have turned their back,
They found themselves surrounded 1

In vain they fought, in vain they fied,
Their chief, humane and tender.

To save the rest, soon thought it best
His forces to surrender.

Brave St. Clair when he first retired
Knew what the fates portended ;
And Arnold and heroic Gates
His conduct have defended.

Thus may America’s brave sons
With honor be rewarded,
And be the fate of all her foes
The same as here recorded.

AUSE not to dream of the future before us ;
Ρ Panse not to weep the wild cares that
come o'er us;
Hark how creation's deep, musical chorus,
Unintermitting, goes up into heaven!
Never the ocean-wave falters in flowing;
N ever the little seed stops in its growing 3
More and more richly the rose heart keeps
glowing,
Till from its nourishing stem it is riven.

“ Labor is worship! ’' the robin is siuging;
“ Labor is worship! '' the wild bee is ringing:
Listen 1 that eloquent whisper‚ upspringing
Speaks to thy soul from out nature’s great
heart.
From the dark cloud flows the life-giving
shower;

From tfhe rough sod blows the soft-breatliing
ower;

From the small insect‚ the rich coral bower3
Only man, in the plau, shrinks from his part.

Labor is life !—'Tis the still water faileth ;

Idleness ever despaireth, bewaileth ς

Keep the watch wound, for the dark rust

assaileth : [noon.

Fiowers droop and die in the stillness of

Labor is glory l-the flying cloud lightens;

Only the waving wing changes and brightens ;

Idle hear-ts only the dark future frightens:

Play the sweet keys, wouldst thou keep η
1110111 111 tune!

Labor is rest from the sorrows that greet us, l
Rest from all petty vexations that meet us, 1
Rest from sin-promptings that ever entreat us, ἔ
Rest from world-sirens tlat lure us to ill. 1
Work—-and pure slumbers shall wait on thy 1
pillows ;
lVork-thou shalt ride over care's coming ζ
billows 1
Lie not down wearied 'neath woe’s weeping
willow 1
Work with a stout beart aud resolute will!
