the memories of its most eminent and hon-

have passed into oblivion, and only a simple
tomb in a village churchyard marks his

all their power, England could not conquer

“ Ι call upon you to witness that I
die like a brave man‚” said Andre, and he
spoke from British and Hessian surround·
ings, seeking only glory and pay. ‘⁴ I regret
that I have only one life to lose for my coun-
try‚” said Hale; and with him and his
comrades self was forgotten in that absorbing‚
passionate patriotism which pledges fortune,
honor and life to the sacred cause.

 

WASHINGTON'S COUNTRY.

LOT out from the page of history the

Β names of all the great actors of his time

in the drama of nations, and preserve

the name of Washington, and the century
would be renowned.

We stand to-day upon the dividing line be-
tween the first and second century of constitu-
tional government. There are no clouds over-
head and no convulsions under our feet. We
reverently return thanks to Almighty God
for the past, and with confident and hopeful
promise march upon sure ground toward the
future. The simple facts of these hundred
years paralyze the imagination‚ and we con-
template the vast accumulations of the century
with awe and pride. Our population has
grown from four to sixty-five millions. Its
centre, moving westward five hundred miles
since 1789, is eloquent with the founding of
cities and the birth of States. New settle-
ments clearing the forests and, subduing the
prairies and adding four millions to the few
thousands of farms which were the support of
Washington’s republic, create one of the great
granaries of the world and open exhaustless
reservoirs of national wealth.

The flower of the youth of the nations of
continental Europe are conscripted from pro-
ductive industries and drilling in camps.
Vast armies stand in battle array along the
frontiers, and a Kaiser's whim or a minister's
mistake may precipitata the most destructive
war of modern times. Both monarchial and
republican governments are seeking safety in

curity. We turn from these gathering storms
to the British Isles and find their people in
the throes of a political crisis involving the
form and substance of their government, and
their statesmen far from confident that the en-
franchised and unprepared masses will wisely
use their power But for us no army exhausts
our resources nor consumes our youth. Our
navy must needs increase in order that the
protecting flag may follow the expanding com-
merce, which is to successfully compete in all
the markets of the world. The sun of our
destiny is still rising, and its rays illuminate
vast territories as yet unoccupied and unde-
veloped, and which are to be the happy homes
of millions of people.

Our institutions furnish the full equipment
of shield and spear for the battles of freedom,
and absolute protection against every danger
which threatens the welfare of the people will
always be found in the intelligence which ap-
preciates their value, and the courage and
morality with which their powers are exer—
cised. The spirit of Washington fills the ex-
ecutive office. Presidents may not rise to the
full measure of his greatness, but they must
not fall below his standard of public duty and
obligation. His life and character, conscien-
tiously studied and thoroughly understood by
coming generations, will be for them a liberal
education for private life and public station,
for citizenship and patriotism‚ for love and
devotion to Union and Liberty. With their
inspiring past and splendid present the people

the repression and suppression of opposition of these United States, with an abiding trust
and criticism. The volcanic forces of demo· in the stability and elasticity of their Consti-

cratic aspiration and socialistic revolt are rap· tution and an abounding faith in themselves,
idly increasing and threaten peace and se· hail the coming century with hope and joy.
