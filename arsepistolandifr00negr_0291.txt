HENRY CLAY.

America's Peerless Orator.

 

    

3⁴9& &HEN reference is made to America's greatest orators it is cus-
{Xy ξ tomary to mention the name of Henry Clay among the very
’ first. He was frequently called, “The Mill Boy of the
’.Χ ‘ ” Slashes,'’ from the fact that he was a poor boy and was born
in a district in Virginia called “the Slashes.’' The date of
his birth was April 12th, 1777, and he died at Washingtom
June, 1852, greatly lamented by the whole country.

He served successively in the Kentucky Legislature, State Senate‚
United States House of Representatives and Senate3 and was one of four
candidates for president in 1824, and also a candidate in 1844, being de-
feated both times. He said he would rather be right than to be President.

In person, Mr. Clay was tall and slender, had a voice of wonderful
range and sympathy‚ was remarkably easy and graceful in manner, and
few orators who ever lived possessed such persuasive power. “ Take him
for all in all,’' says Parton, “we must regard him as the first of American
orators3 but posterity will not assign him that rank, because posterity
will not hear that matchless voice, will not see those large gestureS, those
striking attitudes, that grand manner, which gave to second-rate compo-
sition first-rate effect. His speeches will long be interesting as the relies
of a magnificent and dazzling personality, and for the light they cast

upon the history of partieS.’'
