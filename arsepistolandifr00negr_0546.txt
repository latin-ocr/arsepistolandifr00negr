498 LORD BYRON.

The triumph and the vanity, Thou, in the sternness of thy strength,
The rapture of the strife3 An equal deed hast done at length,
The earthquake voice of victory, And darker fate hast found:
To thee the breath of life ; He fell, the forest-prowlers' prey;
The sword, the sceptoe, and that sway But thou must eat thy heart away!

Which man seemed made but to obey, ¹ .
xvherewith renown was ᾖξε,- Thme evll deeds are writ in gore,

All quelled l—Dark spirit! what must be Nor written thus in vain 3

The madness of thy memory! Thy triumphs tell Of fame no more,
Or deepen every stam.

If thou hadst died as honor dies,
Some new Napoleon might arise,

To shame the world again ;
But who would soar the solar height,

The desolator desolate!
The victor overthrown 1
The arbiter of others’ fate

Ι f& S'upphantfor his (fwnl To set in such a starless night!

s it some yet lmperla hope,

That with such change can calmly eope? Weighed jn the balance, hero dust
Or dread of death alone? 15 vile as vulgar clay3

TO die a princes ΟΥ live a 313176- Thy scales, mortality! are just

Thy choice is most ignobly brave! ΤΟ all than pass aW353

But yet methought the living great

He who of old would rend the oak Some higher spark should animate,
Dreamed not of the rebound ; To dazzle and dismay 3

Chained by the trunk he vainly broke— Nor deemed contempt could thus make mirth
Alone—how looked he round? Of these, the conquerors of the earth.

SHE WALKS IN BEAUTY.

HE walks in beauty like the night Or softly lightens o’er her face3
Of cloudless elimes and starry skies; WVhere thoughts serenely sweet express
And all that's best of dark and bright How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.

Meets iu her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.

And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,

The smiles that win, the tints that glow,

One shadc the more, one ray the less, But tell of days in goodness spent,
Had half impaired the nameless grace A mind at peace with all below,

Which waves in every raven tress, A heart whose love is innocent.

 

 

ENSLAVED GREEOE.
E who hath bent him o'er the dead The languor of the placid cheek ;

Ere the first day of death is fled,—- And—but for that sad, shrouded eye,
(The first dark day of nothingness‚ That fires not, wins not, weeps not now,—
The last of danger and distress)— And but for that ehill, changeless brow
Before Decay’s effaeing fingers Where old Obstruction's apathy
Have swept the lines where beauty lingers; Appals the gaziug mourner's heart,
And marked the mild, angelic air, As if to him it could impart
The rapture of repose that's there, The dooms he dreads‚ yet dwells upon.—

T he fixed, yet tender traits that ‘streak Yes, but for these and these alone,
