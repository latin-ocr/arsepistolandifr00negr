HENRY CLAY.

But, sir, it is not first and chiefly for and invoking the aid of Heaven to spare
Greece that I wish to see this measure adopted. Greece, and to invigorate her arms ; while

It will give them but little aid—that aid
purely of a moral kind. It is, indeed, sooth-
ing and solacing, in distress, to hear the
accents of a friendly voice. We know this as
a people. But, sir, it is principally and
mainly for America herself, for the credit and
character of our common country, that I hope
to see this resolution pass; it is for our own
unsullied name that I feel.

What appearance, sir, on the page of history,
would a record like that makez—-“In the
month of January, in the year of our Lord
and Saviour, 1824, while all European Christ-
endom beheld with cold, unfeeling apathy the
unexampled wrongs and inexpressible misery
of Christian Greece, a proposition was made
in the Congress of the United states—almost
the sole, the last, the greatest repository of
human hope and of human freedom, the rep-
resentatives of a nation capable· of bringing
into the field a million of bayonets—while the
freemen of that nation were spontaneously
expressing its deep-toned feeling, its fervent
prayer for Grecian success; while the whole
continent was rising, by one simultaneous
motion, solemnly and anxiously supplicating

temples and senate-houses will be resounding
with one burst of generous sympathy—-in the
year of our Lord and Saviour—that Saviour
alike of Christian Greece and of us, a propo-
sition was offered in the American Congress,
to send a messenger to Greece to inquire into
her state and condition, with an expression of
our good wishes and our sympathies-and it
was rejected Ι ”

Go home, if you dare—go horne, if you
can—to your constituents‚ and tell them that
you voted it down! Meet, if you dare, the
appalling countenances of those who sent you
herc, and tell them you shrank from the
declaration of your own sentiments; that, you
cannot tell how, but that some unknown
dread, some indescribable apprehension, some
indefinable danger, affrighted you; that the
spectres of cimeters and crowns, and crescente
gleamed before you; and that you suppressed .
all the noble feelings prompted by religion, by
liberty, by national independence, and by
humanity! I cannot bring myself to believe

that such will be the feeling of a majority of
this House.

Greece and Rome flourished in their greatest
prosperity, and mingling in the throng should
ask a Grecian if he did not fear that some

unjust insinuation. Yet Greece fell; Caesar
passed the Rubicon, and the patriotic arm
even of Brutus could not preserve the liberties
of his devoted country.
