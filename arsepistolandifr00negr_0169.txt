GEoRGE BANCROFT.

Historiam and Statesman.

 

X ’λ v< O historian in either hemisphere has done more admirable work
,ν’ than Mr. Bancroft. Gifted with fine mental endowments, which
γ’ ἱ, were zealously cultivated, he was pre-eminently qualified to
ἓν ' write his country's history, and 561 1116 great events of that
history in their true order, allowing them to speak for them-
selves with an eloquence to which nothing could be added.

Two essential requisites belong to every historian who is worthy of
the name. He must be able to trace the logical sequence between events,
and he must be absolutely without prejudice or partisan bias. He does
not create facts; he sets them forth, and they tell their own story. Mr.
Bancroft is a peerless historian. He was born in Vv'orcester, Massachus-
etts, in the year 1800. His father, the Reverend Aaron Bancroft, D. D.,
who died at an advanced age in 1839, after having been for more than half
a century minister of a Congregational church in that town, was a 11160-
logical and historical writer of some reputation, and was eminently dis-
tinguished for the liberality of his views, the kindness of his manners,
and the spotless purity of 1115 character.

At the early age of thirteen Mr. Bancroft entered Harvard College,

 

where he graduated in 1817, with the first honors of his class. He had
determined to study theology, and his essay on this occasion, for which
he received from the corporation 0116 of the Bowdoin prizes, was 011 1116
Use and Necessity of Revelation. In the following year, he went to Ger-
many, and devoted himself two years to the study of history and philology,
under Professor Heeren, at Gottingen, where he received the degree of
Doctor of Philosophy. He then went to Berlin, where he became ac-
quainted with Schlosser, the first of German historians, who awakened
his taste for history. Before his return he also visited Italy and France,
and stayed a short time in London.

Indeed he preached a few times, in a manner that induced predictions

that he would greatly distinguish himself in the pulpit. But he was dis-
