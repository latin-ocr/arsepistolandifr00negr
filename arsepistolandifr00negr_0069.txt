received with charity. Mr. Emerson has undoubtedly exerted a very wide
influence upon the thinkers and writers of our time. He 1135 been to them
a kind of oracle, and while it was impossible to imitate his style, his very
personality, one might almost say, has entered into a considerable part of
American literature, especially that of New England authors. It was at
Concord that the poet and philosopher gathered around him congenial
spirits, making his home a shrine sacred 111 1116 thought of kindred spirits,
In this city he continued to live until his death occurred, April 27th, 1882,

him, and he appeared to think that he was launching a scheme that
would revolutionize society and lift it up to 311 ideal state. Many emi-

Mr. Emerson is distinguished for originality as well as for subtlety
of intellect. One cannot, however, help suspecting that in his love for
originality and his anxiety to shake himself wholly free from the tram-
