All the while the swaying cars
Kept rumbling o’er the rail,

And the frequent whistle seut
Shrieks of anguish to the gale,

And the eiuders pattered down
On the grimy fioor like hail.

WVhen suddenly ajar,

And a thrice-repeated bunip,
Made the people. in alarm

From their easy eushionsjump ;
For they deemed the sounds to be

The inevitable trump.

A splintering erash below,
A doom-foreboding twiteh,
As the tender gave a lurch
Beyond the flying switeh‚—
And a mangled mass of men
Lay writhing in the ditch.

FAVORITE POEMS AND PROSE SELECTIONS.

With a palpitating heart
My friend essayed to rise;
There were bruises on his limbs
And stars before his eyes,
And his face was of the hue
Of the dolphin when it dies.

I was very well content

In escaping with my life;
But my mutilated friend

Commeneed a legal strife,—
Being thereunto incited

By his lawyer and his wife.

And he writes me the result,
In his quiet way as follows:
That his case came up before

A bench of legal scholars,
Who awarded him his claim,

Of 81500!

OLUMBIA, Columbia, to glory arise,

The queen of the world, and eh[ild of-
hold, '

the ski‹s !
Thy genius eonimands thee; with rapture be-
While ages on ages thy splendors unfold,

Thy reign is the last and the noblest of time, .

Most fruitful thy soil, most inviting thy elime;

Let the crimes of the east ne'er encrimson thy
name,

Be freedom and seienee and virtue thy fame.

To conquest and slaughter let Europe aspire;
NVhelrn nations in hlood, and wrap cities in fire;
Thy heroes the rights of mankind shall defend,
And triumph pursue them, and glory attend.
A world is thy realm ; for a world be thy laws,
Enlarged as thiue empire, and just as thy cause ;
On Freed om's broad basis that empire shall rise,
Extend with the main, and dissolve with the
skies.

Fair Seienee her gates to thy sons shall unbar,
And the east see thy morn hide the beams of
her star.

 

New bards and new sages unrivalled shall soar

To fame uuextinguished when time is no more;

To thee, the last refuge of virtue designed,

Shall fiy from all nations the best of mankind3

Here grateful to heaven, with transport shall
bring

Their incense, more fragrant than odors of
spring.

Nor less shall thy fair ones to glory ascend,
And genius and beauty in harmony blend; -
The grac-es of form shall awake pure desire,
And the charnis of the seul ever cherish the fire;
Their sweetness unmingled, their manners re-

fined,

And virtue’s bright image, enstamped on the
mind,

With peace and soft rapture shall teach life
to glow,

And light up a smi!e on the aspect of woe.

Thy fleets to all regions thy power shall dis-
ssa v,
The naiioris admire‚ and the ocean obey:
