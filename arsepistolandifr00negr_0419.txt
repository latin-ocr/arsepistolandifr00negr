ground on hand—organs, whistled in the streets‚ and Sweet Alice became
the pet of the public. A steamboat in the West, and a ship in the East‚
were named after her. The steamer was blown up, and the ship was
wrecked, but Alice fioated safely in the fragile bark of song, The poem
went abroad and obtained great popularity in England. The streets of
London were fiooded with parodies, answers, and imitations‚ printed on
broadsides, and sung and sold by curbstone minstrels. A play was writ-
ten there based upon it, and as late as 1877 a seria] novel ran through a
London weekly paper of note, in which the inenlories evoked by the sing-
ing of “ Ben Bolt ’' played a prominent part.

Mr. English was elected a member of the New Jersey State Legis-
lature in 1863 and 1864. In 1890 he was elected a Representative from
the Sixth Congressional district of New Jersey to the Fifty-Second Con-
gress, and afterward was several times returned to Congress by the same

constituency. Died April 1, 1902.

 

BEN BOLT.

ON’T you remember sweet Alice, Ben And where once the lords of the forest

⁶?
Sweeltgffilice whose hair was so brown,
Who wept with delight when you gave her a
AndStTdigbled with fear at your frown‘?
In the old churchyard in the valley, Ben
In a {giiii'er obscure and alone,
They have fitted a slab of the granite so gray,
And Alice lies under the stone.

Under the hickory tree, Ben Bolt,
Which stood at the foot of the hill,

Together we've lain in the noonday shade,
And listened to Appleton's mill:

The mill-wheel has fallen to piceos, Ben Bolt,
The rasters have tumbled in,

And a quiet which crawls round the walls as

you gaze,
Has followed the olden din.

Do you mind the cabin of logs, Bon Bou,
At the edge of the pathless wood,

And the button-ball tree with its motley limbs,
Which nigh by the door—step stood ⁴?

The cabin to ruin has gone, Ben Bou,
The tree you would seek in vain ;

 

waved,
Grow grass and the golden grain.

And don't you remember the school, Ben
Bolt
With the, master so cruel and grim,
And the shaded nook in the running brook,
VVhere the children went to swim ἶ)
Grass grows on the master’s grave, Ben
Bolt
The spring of the brool< is dry,
And of all the boys that were schoolmates
then,
There are only you and I.

There is change in the things Ι loved, Ben

TheyBlilziise changed from the old to the
But I ntfegl'ili the core of my spirit the

truth,
There never was change in you.

Twelvemonths twenty have past, Ben Bolt,
Since first wc were friends- yet I hail

Thy presence a blessing, thy friendship a
Ben tlgblltiiiof the salt-sea gale.
