O woman, woman! '' Ι cried, my feelins

full of wimin's rites noshus go round like

ARTEMUS WARD VISITS THE SHAKERS.

“ R. SHAKER‚” sed I, “ you see before
you a Babe in the Woods‚ so to
speak‚ and axes a shelter of yon.''

“ Yay,’'said the shaker, and he led the way
into the house, another bein’ sent to put my
horse and wagon under kiver.

A solum female, lookin' somewhat like a
last year's bean-pole stuck into a long meal-
bag, cum in and axed me was I athirst and
did I hunger? To which Ι asserted, “A few,''
She went orf, and I endeavored to open a
conversation with the old man.

“Elder‚ Ι spect,’' sed Ι.

“ Yay‚'’ he said.

“Health's good, Ι reckon ⁴? '⁵

“ Yay.''

“ What's the wages of a Elder‚ when he un-
'derstands his bizness—or do you devote your
sarvices gratooitous? ''

“Yay.''

“Storm nigh‚ sir?’'

‘t Yay·’'

“If the storm continues there'll be a mess
underfoot‚ hay? ''

“ Yay.'’

“ If Ι may be so bold, kind sir, what's the

price of that pecooler kind of wesket you
wear, includin trimmin's? ''

1333& a minit, and, thinkin’ I’d be fass-
shus with him and see how that would go, I

slapt him on the shoulder, burst into a hearty
larf, and told him that as a yayer he had no
livin’ ekel.

He jumped up as if bilin' water had been
squirted into his ears, groaned, rolled his eyes
up tords the sealin' and sed:

“ You're a man of sin 1 ’'

He then walked out of the room.

Directly thar cum in two young Shaker-
esses, as putty and sliek lookin' galls as Ι ever
met. It is troo they was drest in meal-bags
like the old one I’d met previsly‚ and their
shiny, silky hair was hid from sight by long,
white caps, such as Ι spose female gosts wear ;
but their eyes sparkled like diamonds, their
cheeks was like roses, and they was charmin'
enuff to make a man throw stuns at his grand-
mother‚ if they axed him to, They oommenst
clearing away the dishes, casting shy glauces
at me all the time. I got exeited. I forgot
Betsey J ane in my rapter, and sez I:

‘⁴ My pretty dears, how air you ’.Ρ ”

“ We air well‚'’ they solumly sed.

“ where is the old man? '' said I, in a soft
voice.

“Of whom dost thou speak—Brother
Uriah ? '’

“ Ι mean that gay and festive cuss who calls
me a man of sin. Shouldn't wonder if his
name was't Uriah.’'

“ He has retired.''
