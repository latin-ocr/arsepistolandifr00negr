dered as he was, he began to straighten up.
ln the minds of all the company the odds
were in his favor. He saw this, and became
ambitious to distinguish himself by spelling
without giving the matter an)v thought.

Ralph always believed that he would have
hoen speedily defeated by Phillips had it not
beon for two things which braced him. The
sinister shadow of young Dr. 8111611 sitting in
1116 dark corner by the water-bucket nerved
him. A victory over Phillips was a defeat to
ono who wished only ill to the young school-
master. The other thought that kept his
pluck alim.¹ was the recollection of Bull. He
approached a word as Bull appronched a rac—
coon. He did not take hold until he was
61116 of his gamo. &Vlien he took hold, it was
with a quiet assurance of success. As Ralph
spelled in this dogged way for half an hour
the hardest words the Squire could find, the
excitement steadily rose in all parts of the
house, and Ralph's friends even ventured to
whisper that “maybe Jim had cotched his
match after all 1 ''

But Phillips never doubted of his success.

“ Theodolite,'' said the Squire.

“ T-h-e, the, o-d‚ od, theod, o, theodo, l-y-t-e‚
theodolite‚'’ spelled the champion.

“ Next,'' said the Squire, nearly losing his
teeth in his excitement.

Ralph spelled the word slowly and correctly,
and the conquered champi‘on sat down in con-
fusion. The excitement was so great for some
minutes that the spelling was suspended.
Everybody in the house had shown sympathy
with one or other of the combatants, except
1116 silent shadow in the corner. It had not

m‹›ved-during the contest, and did not show
any interest now in the result.

“ Gewhilliky crickets! Thunder and light-
ning! Licked him all to smash! ’' said Bud,
rubbing his hands 011 his knees. “ That beats
my time all holler 1 ’'

And Betsy 811011 giggled until her tuck-
comb fell 0111, though she was on the defeated
side.

Shocky got up and dnnced with pleasure.

But 0116 suffocating look from the aqueous

eyes of Mirandy destroyed the last spark ol
Ralph's pleasure in his triumph, and sent that
awful below-zero feeling all through him.

“He's power-ful smart, is the master‚'’ said
old J ack to Mr. Pete J ones, “ Η6ἸΙ beat the
whole kit and tuck of ’em afore he's through.
I know’d he was smart. That‘s the reason I
tuck him‚'’ proceeded Mr. Means.

“Yaas, but he don’t lick enough.
nigh‚'' answered Pete 501166.
16111111’ ,says I.”

Young men were timidly asking girls if
they could‘ ‘see them safe home,' which 16
1116 approved formula, and were trembling' 111
mortal fear of “the mitten.'' Presently the
Squire thinking it time to close the contest,
pulled his scalp forward, adjusted his glass
eye, which had been examining his nose long
enough, and turned over the leaves of the
book to the great words at the place known
to spellers as ‘⁴ Incomprehensibility,’' and be—
gan to give out those “words of eight sylla-
bles with the accent on the sixth.'' Listless
scholars now turned round, and ceased to
whisper, in order to be in at the master's final
triumph.

But to their surprise, “ole Miss Meanses'

Not
“ No lickin', no

white nigger,’' as some of them called her, in
allusion to her slavish life, spelled these great
words with as perfect ease as the master. still,
not doubting the result, the Squire turned
from place to place and selected all the hard
words 116 could find. The school became ut-
terly quiet, the excitement was too great for
the ordinary buzz. Would “Meanses’ Han-
1161 ” beat the master? Beat the master that
had laid out 51111 Phillips? Everybody's
sympathy was now turned to Hannah. Ralph
noticed that even Shocky had deserted him,
and that his face grew brilliant every time
Hannah spelled a word. In fact, Ralph
deserted himself. lf he had not felt that a

victory given would insuit her, he would have '

missed intentionally. “1Ϊ)-1ς11611601γρ6,” suif-
fled the Squire. It was Ralph’ s turn.
“-D -a- u, dau —-
“.''Next
And Hannah spelled it right.
