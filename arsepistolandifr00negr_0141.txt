“The Good Grey Poet.''

 

    

 

5W{ HE name of “The Good Grey Poet ’' was given to Mr. Whitman
Ἀ Υ probably on account of his venerable appearance during his
{j last years. With a heavy head of white hair, long grey
whiskers, clear complexion and benevolent expression, he was
a striking figure when he appeared, as he often did, on the
streets of philadelphia. Many knew him and always gave
him a kindly look. He was a man of large, warm heart, a thinker
of bold and earnest type and one who cared very little for the world's
red tape.

He was born of mingled English and Dutch stock on May 31st‚ 1819,
at West Hills, Loug Island‚ in New York State, and died on March 27th‚
1892, at Camden, New Jersey, where he resided. Iu early life he exhi-

    

     

  

bited some of those erratic tendencies which are quite frequently the ac-
companiments of genius, That he was a genius of a certain order is
commonly admitted, and his admirers have been quite as numerous
abroad as they have been in his own country. He followed the trade of a
printer for a while and in 1846 was editor of a Brooklyn journal.

All along haunted by the yearning and sense of obligation to pro-
duce a life-work, Whitman seemed quite unable to find full and free ex-
pressions for his emotions and thoughts until he hit upon the curious,
irregular, recitative measures in which he composed the “Leaves of
Grass.'' When first issued in 1855 this was a small volume, but it grew
in the course of seven succeeding editions till it contained nearly 400
pages. The later and complete editions, taken together with his prose
book, “Specimen Days and Collect,’' may be held to embrace the life-
work of Whitman as a writer. That he lived up to the high sentiments
expressed in his writings no one can doubt.

μ During the Civil War he went to the front and became a nurse to
the wounded, the suffering and dying. Not Florence Nighfingale, with

all her tenderness, could surpass his gentle ministries on the field of bat-
