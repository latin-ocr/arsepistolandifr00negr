“ Cowper's Grave ’³ was published in 1838.

In 1846 she was married to the poet, Robert Browning, with whom
she resided iu Italy for many years. She produced in 1851 “Casa Guidi
Windows,’‘ a poem which treats of the political condition of Italy.
“This,'' says the “North British Review,'’ “is the happiest of Mrs.

artistic character, and is really a simple story of personal impressions.'’
Her largest, and withal her greatest work, is “Aurora Leigh‚’' a poem,
or novel in verse, which is greatly admired. This was published in 1856,
and in the same year a new addition of her poems was issued in three
volumes. She died at Florence, Italy, in June, 1861.
