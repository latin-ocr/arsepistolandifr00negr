A DREAM.
ΙΤ was but a dream I had And it was dawn and middle day
While the musioians played— And miduight—for the moon
⁷ And here the sky and here the glad On silver rounds across the bay
Old ocean 11133611 the glade; Had climbed the skies of June—
And 11616 the laughing ripples ran, And here the glowing‚ glorious king
And here the 10363 grew Of day ruled o'er the realm,
That threw a kiss to every man With stars of midnight glittering
That voyaged with the crew. About the diadem.
Our silken 36113 111 lazy folds The sea-gull reeled on languid wing
Dropped in the breathless breeze In 6116163 round the mast ;
As o’er a field of marigolds We heard the songs the 3116113 sing
Our eyes swam o’er the 3663; As we went sailing past,
While here the eddies lisped 61111 purled And up and down the golden sande
Around the island's rim, A thousand fairy throngs
And up from out the under world Flung at us from their flashing hand

We saw the merman swim. The 6011063 of their songs.
