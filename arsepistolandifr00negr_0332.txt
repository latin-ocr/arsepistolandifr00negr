284 WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS.

“The Undiscovered Country,‘’ 18803 “ Dr. Breen's Praetiee,'’ 18833 “A
VVoman's Reason,'' 18845 “ The Rise of Silas Lapha1n‚'' 18853 “ Annie
Kilburn,'' 18883 “The Landlord at Lion's Head,'' 1897.

It is thus seen that Mr. Howells is a voluminous author, which

means that he is a great worker. His stray pieces, comprising contribu-
tious to periodieals, are very numerous. He was an intimate friend of
Lowell, and one of the most appreciative and just tributes to this re-
nowned author is from Mr. Howells' pen.

Mr. Howells' rank among American authors is high, and his position
is well assured. While he fails frequently to get at the real heart of
things and deals too much with details and what is superficiaL he 13 yet
a successful author, and his works are enjoyed by a large and intelligent
class of readers, who are not enamored with sensational stories.

 

LOST BELIEFS.

 

NE after one they left us; Oh, my Life! with thy upward lifting,
The sweet birds of our breast Thy downward-striking roots,
lVent flying away 111 the morning: Ripening 0111 of thy tendor blossoms
Will they come again to their nests? But hard and bitter 1111113-
will they come again at nightfall‚ In thy boughs there is no shelter
With God's breath in their song? For my birds to seek again !
Noon is fierce with the heats of summer, Ah 1 the desolate nest 13 broken
And summer days are long ! And torn with storms and rain i
ANDENKEN.
HE bobolink sings 111 1116 meadow, who was it that last night kissed thee
The wren 111 the cherry—tree: Under the cherry-tree?

Come hither, thou little maiden,

And sit upon my knee; Like a bird of evil presage,

To the lonely house on the shore

And I will tell thee a story, Came the wind with a tale of shipwreck,
I read in a book ot' rhymes; And sh1·iek‹ d at the bolted door,

I will but feign that it happened

TO me, one summer time, And flapped its wings in the gables,

And shouted the well-know names,
NVhen we walked through the mead 'jw And huffeted the windows

And she and I were young3 Afeared 111 their shudclering frames.
The story is old and wearied

xvith being said ‚dud sung. [t was night, and 11 13 ‹laytime—

The morning sun is bland,
The story is old and wem-iod ; The white-cap waves come 1-061ζῐι1ἕἲ
Ah, child! 13 11 known to thee? In to the smiling land.
