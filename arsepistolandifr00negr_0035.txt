HENRY WaoswoRTH LoNGFELLow.

America’s Favorite Poet.

 

’χ *²* R-O POET in either hemisphere has gained a distinction more
„ j enviable than that of Longfellow‚ or has done it more
ἃ ¹⁶} f gracefully. It must be admitted by every reader that there

¹ ' is a peculiar charm about his productions, and for this rea-
son one of the greenest of laurels adorns the brow of this
favorite American poet, who, it has been said, is even more
extensively read and admired in England than at home. Many of his
productions are as familiar in the homes
of the people as the old time almanac
used to be in the homesteads of our
grandfathers.

Longfellow studied the principles of
verbal melody, and rendered himself inas-
ter of the mysterious affinities which ex· ’;
ist between sound and sense, word and 43·-
thought, feeling and expression. There
is an aptitude, gracefulness and vivid
beauty in many of his stanzas which at
once impress the memory and win ear and heart. There is in the tone of
his poetry little passion, but much quiet earnestness. His ideas and met-
aphors are often striking and poetical, but there is no affluence of imagery
or wonderful glow of emotion such as take us captive in Byron or Shelley3
the claim of Longfellow consists in the wise and tasteful use of his
materials rather than in their richness and their originality. He
illustrates the gentler themes of song, and pleads for justice, humanity,
and particularly the beautiful, with a poet's deep conviction of their eterna]
claims upon the distinctive recognition of mankind. The encomium pro«
nounced upon him by Francis F. Brown cannot fail of general apprecia-
tion:

“ Ο thou revered, beloved! not yet with sob of bells, with eyes tear wet,
With faltering pulses do we lay thy greatness in the grave away ;

Not Auburn’s consecrated ground can hold the life that wraps thee round.
