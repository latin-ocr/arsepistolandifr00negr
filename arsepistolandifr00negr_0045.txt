HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW.

But 311 perished alike beneath the scourge of
his anger ;

Only, alas! the poor, who had neither friends
nor attendants,

Crept away to die in the almshouse‚ home of
the homeless.

Then in the suburbs it stood, in the midst of
meadows and woodlands;

Now the city surrounds it; but still with its
gateway and wicket,

Meek in the midst of splendor, its humble
walls seems to echo

Softly the words of the Lord: “ The poor ye
always have with you.’'

Thither by night and day, came the Sister of
Mercy. The dying

Looked up into her face, and thought, indeed,
to behold there

Gleams of celestial light encircle her fore-
head with splendor,

Such as the 311151 paints o’er the brows of
saints and apostles,

Or such as hang by night o’er a city seen at a
distance.

Unto their eyes it seemed the lamps of the
city celestial,

Into whose shining gates their spirits ere long
would enter.

Thus, on a Sabbath morn, through the streets
deserted and silent,

Wending her quiet way, she entered the door
of the almshouse.

Sweet on the summer air was the odor of
flowers in the garden,

And she paused on her way to gather the
fairest among them,

That the dying once more might rejoice in
their splendor and beauty.

Then, as she mounted the stairs to the cor-
ridors, cooled by the east wind,

Distant and soft on her ear fell the chimes
from the belfry of Christ Church,

While intermingled with these, across the
meadows were wafted

Sounds of Psalms that were sung by the
Swedes at their church in WicacO.

Soft as descending wings fell the calm of the
hour on her spirit ;

Something within her said: “At length her
trials are ended ;”

And, with light in her looks, she entered the
chamber of sickness,

Noiselessly moved about the assiduous, careful
attendants,

Moistening the feverish lips, and the aching
brow, and in silence

Closing the sightless eyes of the dead, and
concealing their faces,

Where on their pallets they lay, like drifts of
snow by the roadside.

Many a languid head, upraised as Evangeline
entered,

Turned on its pillow of pain to gaze while she
passed, for her presence

Fell on their hearts like a ray of sun on the
walls of a prison.

And, as she looked around, she saw how
Death, the consoler,

Laying his hand upon many a heart, had
healed it forever.

Many familiar forms had disappeared in the
night time ;

Vacant their places were, or filled already by
strangers.

Suddenly, as if arrested by sear or a feeling
of wonder,

Still she stood, with her colorlvss lips apart,
while a shudder

Ran through her frame, and, forgotten, the
flowers dropped from her fingers,

And from her eyes and cheeks the light and
bloom of the morning;

Then there escaped from her lips a cry of such
terrible anguish

That the dying heard it and started up from
their pillows.

On the pallet before her was stretched the
form of an old man 3

Long, and 111111, and gray, were the locks that
shade his temples 3

But, as he lay in the morning light, his face
for a moment

Seemed to assume once more the forms of its
earlier manhood ;

So are wont to be changed the faces of those
who are dying.

Hot and red on his lips still burned the flush
of the fever,
