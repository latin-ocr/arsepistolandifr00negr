412 JOHN PIERPONT.

The “ Airs of Palestine '⁷ is a poem of about eight hundred lines, i'n
the heroic measure, in which the influence of music is shown by exam-
ples, principally from sacred history. The religious sublimity of the
sentiments, the beauty of the language, and the finish of the versification,
placed it at once, in the J udgment of all competent to form an opinion on
the subject, before any poem at that time produced in America. As a
work of art, it would be nearly faultleSS, but for the occasional introduc-
tion of double rhymes, a violation of the simple dignity of the ten—syllable
verse, induced by the intention of the author to recite it in a public
assembly.

He says in the preface to the third edition, that he was “ aware how
difficult even a good speaker finds it to rehearse heroic poetry, for any
length of time, without perceiving in his hearers the somniferous effects
of a regular cadence,'' and “the double rhyme was, therefore, occasionally
thrown in, like a ledge of rocks in a smoothly gliding river, to break the
current, which, without it, might appear sluggish, and to vary the melody
which might otherwise become monotonous.’' The following passage,

dscriptive of a moonlight scene in Italy, will give the reader an idea of
its manner:

“ Hark !—’tis a convent's bell : its midnight chime ;
For music measures even the march of time 2——
O'er bending trees, that fringe the distant shore,
Gray turrets rise :—the eye can catch no more.
The boatman, listening to the tolling bell,
Suspends his oar :—a low and solemn swell,
From the deep shade, that round the cloister lies,
Rolls through the air, and on the water dies.
What melting song wakes the cold ear of Night?
A funeral dirge, that pale nuns, robed in white,
Chant round a sister’s dark and narrow bed,
To charin the parting spirit of the dead.
Triumphum: is the spell ἔ with raptured ear,
That uncaged spirit hovering, lingers near 3—
Why should she mount? why pant for brighter bliss‘?
A lovelier scene, a sweeter song, than this !''

“Many of his hymns, odes and other brief poems,'' says Griswold‚
“are remarkably spirited and melodious.'‘ Mr. Pierpont in his ripe age

was strikingly venerable iu appearance and continued in active pursuits
until his death, which occurred in 1866.
