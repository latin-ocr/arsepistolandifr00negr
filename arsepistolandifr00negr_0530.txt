He, a parliamentary leader of twenty years
standing, is so ignorant of the House of Com-
mons that he positively thought he got a par-

opponent of the Reform Bill of 1832. As the

THE IRISH OHUROH.

F we are prudent men, I hope we shall en-
deavor as far as in us lies to make some
provision for a contingent, a doubtful, and
probably a dangerous future. If we be chiv-
alrous men, I trust we shall endeavor to wipe
away all these stains which the eivilized world
has for ages seen, or seemed to see, on the
shield of England in her treatment of Ireland.
If we be compassionate men, I hope we shall
now, once for all, listen to the tale of woe
which comes from her, and the reality of
which, if not its justice, is testified by the eon-

tinuous emigration of her people—that we
shall endeavor to

“ Pluck from her memory a rooted sorrow,
And raze the written troubles froin her brain.”

But, above all, if we be just men, we shall go
fi›1·wa1·d in the name of truth and right, bear-
ing this in mind—that when the caseis proved
and the honr is come, justice delayed is jus-
tice ‹lenied.

There are many who think that to lay hands
upon the national Church Establishment of a
country is a profane and unhallowed act. I
respect that feeling. 1 sympathize with it
while I think it my ‹lnty to overcome and re-

press it. But if it be an error, it is an error
entitled to respect. There is something in
the idea of a national establishment of reli-
gion, of a solemn appropriation of a part
of the Commonwealth for conferring upon
all who are ready to receive it What we know
to be an inestiniable benefit3 of saving
that portion of the inhoritance from private
selfishness, in order to extract from it, if we
can, pure and unmixed advantages of the
highest order for the population at large.

There is something in this so attractive that
it is an ini-age that must always command the
homage of the many. It is somewhat like the
kingly ghost in Hamlet, of which one of the
characters of Shakespeare says :

“ We do it wrong, being so majestical,
To offer it the show of violence ;
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
And our vain blows malicious mockery.''

But, sir, this is to view a religious establish-
ment upon one side, only upon what I may
call the etherea] side. It has likewisea side of
