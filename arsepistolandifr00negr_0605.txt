LORD MACAULAY.

gaze full on the intolerable brightness‚ and to
commune with him face to face. Hence
originated their contempt for terrestrial dis-
tinctions.

The difference between the greatest and
meanest of mankind seemed to vanish when
compared with the boundless interval which
separated the whole race from him on whom
their own eyes were constantly fixed.

They recognized no title to superiority but
his favor; and, confident of that favor, they
despised all the accomplishments and all the
dignities of the world. If they were unac-
quainted with the works of philosopher-s and
poets, they werc deeply read in the eracles
of God; if their names were not sound in the
registers of heralds, they felt assured that
they were recorded in the Book of Life; if
their steps were not accompanied by a splen-
did train of menials‚ legions of ministering
angels had charge over them. Their palaces
were houses not made with hands; their
diadems, crowns of glory which should never
fade away.

On the rich and the eloquent, on nobles
and priests, they looked down with contempt ;
for they esteemed themselves rich in amore

precious treasure, and eloquent in a more
sublime language—nobles by the right of an
earlier creation, and priests by the imposition
of a mightier hand. The very meanest of
them was a being to whose fate a mysterious
and terrible importance belonged—on whose
slightest actions the spirits of light and dark—
ness looked with anxious interest—who had
been destined, before heaven and earth were
created, to enjoy a felicity which should con-
tinue when heaven and earth should have

passed away.
Events which short-sighted politicians ns-

cribed to earthly causes had beon ordained
on his account. For his sake empires had
risen and fiourished and decayed; for his
sake the Almighty had proclaimed his will
by the pen of the evangelist and the harp of
the prophet. He had been rescued by no
common deliverer from the grasp of no com-
mon f0e; he had been ransomed by the sweat
of no vulgar agony, by the blood of no earthly
sacrifice. It was for him that the sun had
been darkened, that the rocks had been rent,
that the dead had arisen, that all nature had
shuddered at the sufferings of her expiring
God!

THE FATE OF VIRGINIA.

Virgini& a Roman maiden‚ celebrated for her beauty and tragical fate, was a daughter

of Lucius Virginius, an officer of the army.

She was betrothed to L. Icilius, a tribune of

the people, from whom the decemvir Appius Claudius wished to abduct her. She was
seized by M. Claudius, one of the agents of Appius, who pretendcd that she was his slave,
and who, in ordcr to prove his claim, took her before the tribunal of Appius. Virginius
arrived at the forum just after the decemvir had decided that she was the slave of Claudius.
He immediately killed her, to deliver her from slavery and dishonor. The people revolted

against the desemvirs and dragged Appius Claudius to prison, where he killed himself.
