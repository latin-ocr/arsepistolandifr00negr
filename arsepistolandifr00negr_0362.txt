THE WIFE.
LL day, like some sweet bird, content to W ith placid fancies of one trusting beart
Α sing That lives but in her Sinile, and turns
In its small enge, she moveth to and fro— From life’s eold¹ seeming and the busy mart,
And ever and anon will upward spring With tenderness, that heavenward ever yearns
To her sweet li ps, fresh from the fouut below, To be. refreshed where one pure altar burns.
The murmur'd nielody of pleasant thought, Shut out from hence the moekery of life,
Uneonseious uttered, gentle-toned and low. Thus liveth she content, the meek, fond,
Light household dutes, evermore inwrought trusting wife.

THE MERRY BROOK.

(ζ HITHER away, thou merry Br00k‚ The ehiming music of the brook,
Whither away so fast, From out the woody dell.
With dainty feet through the
meadow green, “ My mountain home was bleak and high.
And a smile as you hurry past? '’ A rugged spot and drear,
The Brook leaped on in idle niirth, With searehing wind and raging storm,
And dimpled with sauey glee3 And moonlight eold and clear.
The daisy kissed in lovingness‚ I longed for a greeting oheery as mine,
And made with the willow free. For a fond and answering look
But none were in that solitude
I heard its laugh adowu the glen‚ To bless the little brook.
And over the roeky steep,
Away where the old tree's roots were bare ' “ The blended hum of pleasant sounds
In the waters dark and deep3 Came up from the vale below,
The sunshine flashed upon its face, And Ι wished that mine were a lowly lot,
And played with fliokering leaf— To lapse, and sing as I go3
Well pleased to dally in its path, That gentle things, with loving eyes,
Though the ‘carrying were brief. Along my path should glide,
And blossoms in their loveliness
“ Now stay thy feet, oh restless one, Come nestling to my side.
NVhere droops the spreading tree,
And let thy liquid voice reveal “ I leaped me down: my rainbow robe
Thy story unto me.'' Hung shivering to the sight,
The flashing pebbles lightly rung, And the thrill of freedom gave to me

As the gushing music fell, New impulse of delight.
