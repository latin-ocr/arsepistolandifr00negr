immense congregation. He was also one of the most popular writers and
most successful lecturers in America His success as a public speaker
was due not so much to what is popularly termed eloquence as to a flow
of racy and original thought, which, though often enlivened with flashes
of quaint humor, was not without an undercurrent of deep moral and
spiritual earnestness.

, As far back as 1850 Mr. Beecher published a volume of “ Lectures
to Young Men.'’ Hc was one of the founders of “The lndependent,''

and for twenty years contributed to that journal over the signature of a
star. He was a powerful leader in the anti-slavery agitation and in the
⁴ cause of temperance.

Of his published works the principal are two series of “ Star Papers,’‘
issued in 1855 and 18583 “Life Thoughts,'’ in 18583 “ Norwood,'' anovel‚
in 18683 and “ Yale Lectures on Preaching,'' in 3 volumes. He left an

unfinished “Life of Christ ’' at his death, which occurred from apoplexy
March 8, 1887.

GOMING AND GOING.

ONCE came to our fields a pair of birds

that had never built a nest nor seen a

winter. O, how beautiful was every-
thing! The fields were full of flowers, and
the grass was growing tall, and the bees were
humming everywhere. Then one of the birds
fell to singing ; and the other bird said, “ Who
told you to sing? '’ And he answered, “The
flowers told me, and the bees told me, and the
winds and leaves told me, and the blue sky
told me, and you told me to sing.'' Then his
mate answered, “ WVhen did I tell you to
sing?’' And he said, “ Every time γοα
brought in tender grass for the nest, and every
time soft wings fluttered off again for hair and
feathers to line the nest.'' Then his mate
said, “What are γοα singing about! '² And
he answered, ‘⁴ I am singing about everything
and nothing. It is because I am so happy
that I sing.''

By and by five little speckled eggs were in
the nest; and his mate said, “Is there any-
' thing in all the world as pretty as my eggs ? '⁷

· Then they both looked down on some people
that were passing by, and pitied them because

 

eggs in them. Then the father-bird sang a
melancholy song because he pitied folks that
had no nests, but had to live in houses.

In a week or two, one day, when the fa-
ther-bird came home, the mother-bird said,
“O, what do γοα think has happened?''
“ What? '' “ One of my eggs has been peep-
ing and moving. ’³ Pretty soon another egg
moved under her feathers‚ and then another,
and another, till five little birds were born.

Now the father-bird sung louder and louder
than ever. The mother-bird, too¹ wanted to
sing; but she had no time, so she turned her
song into work. So hungry were these little
birds that it kept both parents busy feeding
them. Away each one flew. The moment
the little birds heard their wings fluttering
again among the leaves, five yellow mouths
fiew open so wide that nothing could be seen
but five yellow mouths.

“Can anybody be happier? ’' said the fa-
ther-bird to the mother-bird. “ We will live
in this tree always ; for there is no sorrow here.
It is a tree that always bears joy.''

The very next day one of the birds dropped

they were not birds, and had no nests with l out of the nest, and a cat ate it up in a min-
