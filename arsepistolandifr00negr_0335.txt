A MOTHER’S PICTURE.

HE seemed an {nigello our infant eyes!
Once, when the glorifying 1110011 revealesl
Her who at evening by our pillow
kneeled--
Soft·voiced and gohien-hahed, from holy
skies
Flown to her loves on wings of Paradise—
We looked to see the pinions half concealed.
The Tuscau vines and olives will not yield

 

Her back to me, who loved her in this wise‚

And since have little known her, but have
grown

To 000 another mother, tenderly‚

Wateh over sleeping children of my own.

Pei-chance the years have changed her: yet
alone

ι This picture lingers ; still she seems to me

The fair young angel of my infancy.

 

VOIGE OF THE WESTERN WIND.

OICE of the western wind l
Thou singest from afar,
Rich with the 11111οἰ0 of a land
VVhere all my memories 111ος
But in thy song I only 110111·
The echo of a tone
That fell divinely on my ear
In days forever flown.

star of the western sky!
Thou beamest from afar,

With lustre caught from eyes Ι knew
those orbs were each a star ;

But, oh, those eyes—too wildly bright—
No more eclipse thine own,

And never shall I find the light
Of days forever flown.

 

THE SLEIGH-RIDE.

ARK! the jingle
Of the sleigh-bells’ song!

High above 110
Gleams the ancient moon,

Earth and alr 5¹¹ SUOWY 3119θῦ com· Gleam the eyes of shining ones that love us:

ming-le ;
Swiftly throng
Norseland fancies as we sail along.

Like the maiden
Of some fairy-tale,
Lying spell-bound, in her diamond-laden

Bridal veil,
Sleeps the Earth beneath 11 gai-ment pale.

Could their tune
Only fill our ears at heaven's noon,

Yon and 1, love,
With a wild delight,
Hearing that seraphic strain would die, love,
This same night,
straight 10 join them in their starry height.
