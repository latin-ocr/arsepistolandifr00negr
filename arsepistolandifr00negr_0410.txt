Author of “The Exiles, and Other Stories''

 

s ,mHOEVER has read that pleasing book entitled, “The West
from a Car Window,’' with its piquant observations and
graphic descriptions, will obtain a very good idea of the per-
sonality of the author. He is robust, vigorous, well suited
to be what may be called a travelling journalist, and as a
newspaper correspondent in the Spanish-American war was
not so anxious to make out a captivating story as he was to describe the
exact situation and avoid exaggeration.

Mr. Davis is more than this. He is a successful writer of fiction.
His work is well studied, is carefully done, is never on a low level, is
characterized by dramatic power. He knows how to deal with what the
novelist would call situations, and can make skillful use of incidents and
events. His outlines, his style, his modes of thought and expression,
are formed from the best models.

He may be said to have inherited a talent for authorship, being the
son of L. Clark Davis, a successful editor, and Rebecca Harding Davis,
a story writer favorably known to the reading public. philadelphia is
his native place, and 1864 the year of his birth. From Lehigh University,
where he pursued his studies three years, he went to Johns Hopkins,
remaining there one year.

Haviug entered journalism he was connected successively with sev-
eral ncwspapers in Philadelphia, including the “Telegraph,'' “Press'’
and “ Record.‘' His most noted work in this line was his “Van Bibber
Sketches,'' which were contributed to the New York “Evening Sun.'’
His story entitled “ Gallagher '’ describes a certain phase of “ life about
town‚'’ and evinces his thorough study of human nature and ability to
depict the character of the easy going hale-fellow-well-met, who is well
known in haunts of vice and pleasure. “Gallagher,'' added materially
to the reputation of the author.

He has also written a book of travels in England‚ depicting in an

original manner the singular aspects of English manners and customs.
