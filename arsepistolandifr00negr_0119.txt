ists,‘’ which was received with great favor both in England and America.
Commenting on this work, Lord Jeffrey says: “ We happen to be very
intense and sensitive admirers of those soft harmonies of studied speech
in which this author is apt to indulge himself, and have caught ourselves
oftener than we shall confess, neglecting his excellent matter to lap our—
selves in the liquid music of his periods.'’ For his “ Tales of a Traveller '³
(1824), Murray, the London publisher‚ gave him ffi7,5oo before he saw the
manuscript.

Mr. Irving afterwards spent some years in France and Spain, where
he composed his “ History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher
Columbus '⁷ (4 vols, 1828), which was very successful. “This is one of
those works,'’ says Alexander H. Everett, “which are at the same time
the delight of readers and the despair of critics. It is as nearly perfect
as any work well can be.’' In 1829 he produced an imaginative and
romantio work entitled “The Chronicle of the Conquest of Granada, from
the Manuscripts of Fray Antonia Agapida.’'

He was appointed secretary of legation to the American embassy at
London in 1829, and returned to the United States in 1832. Among his
later works are “ The Alhambra (1832), 3 “ Tour on the Prairies'’ (1835),
“Astoria'' (3 vols., 1836), “The Adventures of Captain Bonneville’' (2
vols.‚ 1837), “ Oliver Goldsmith, a Biography '³ (1849), “ Mahomet and
His Successors '’ (1850), and “The Life of George Washington '' (5 vols,
1855-59). He was minister to Spain from 1842 to 1846. Η6 passed the
latter part of his life at Sunnyside, on the Hudson River, where he died,
November 28th‚ 1859. Η6 was never married.

For 311 easy elegance of style, Irving has no superior, perhaps no
equal among the prose writers of America. If Hawthorne excels him in
variety, in earnestness and in force, he is perhaps inferior to Irving in
facility and grace3 while he can make no claim to that genial‚ lambent
humor which beams in almost every page of “ Geoffrey Crayon.’' Whether
in writing “ Rip Van Winkle ’' or the story of Columbus, his pen always
has the same betwitching charm and its product is rich beyond rivalry.

James Russell Lowell, himself one of America's admired authors.
pays Irving this unique compliment:

What! Irving? thrice welcome warm heart and fine brain,
You bring back the happiest spirit from Spain,

And the gravest sweet humor, that ever were there

Since Oervantes met death in his gentle despair ;
