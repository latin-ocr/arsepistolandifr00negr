BEING
ONE of the best things in the world to be

is a boy; it requires no experience,

though it needs some practice to be a
good one. The disadvantage of the position
is that it does not last long enough. It is
soon over. Just as you got used to being a
boy, you have to be something else, with a
good deal more work to do, and not half so
much fun.

And yet every hoy is anxious to be'a man,
and is very uneasy with the restrictions that
are put upon him as a boy. There are so
many bright spots in the life of a farm boy
that I sometimes think Ι should like 10 live
the life over again. Ι should almost be will-
ing to be a girl if it were not for the chores,

There is a great comfort to a boy in the
amount of work he can get rid of doing. It
is sometimes astonishing how slow hc can
go on an errand. Perhaps he eouldn’t ex-
plain, himself, why, when he is sent to the
neighbor's after yeast‚ he stops to stone the
frogs. He is not exactly cruel, but he wants

A YOUNG

SHOULD think myself a criminal, if Ι
said anything to chill the enthusiasm of
the young scholar, or to dash with any

scepticism his longing and his hope. He has
chosen the highest. His beautiful saith, and
his aspiration, are the light of life. Without
his fresh enthusiasm‚ and his gallant devotion
to learning, to art, to culture, the world
would be dreary enough.

Through him eomes the ever-springing in-

spiration in affairs. Baffled at every turn,

to see 'if he can hit ’em. It is a curious fact
about boys, that two will bc a great deal
slower in (hung anything thau one. Boys
have a great power of helping each other do
nothing, But say what you will about the
general usefulness of boys, a farm without a
boy would very soon come to grief, He is
always in demand.

In the first place, he is to do all the errandst
go to the store, the post-office, and to carry all
sorts of messages. He would like to have as
many legs as a wheel has spokes, and rotate
about in the same way. This he sometimes
tries to do, and people who have seen him
“turning cart-wheels'’ along the side of the
road have supposed he was amusing himself
and idling his time. He was only trying to
invent a new mode of 1060111011011, so that he
could economize his legs and do his errands
with greater dispatch. Leap-frog is one of
his methods of getting over 1116 ground
quickly. He has a natural genius for eom-
bining pleasure with business.

and driven defeated from an hundred fields
he carries victory in himself. Hc belongs to
a great and immortal army.

And some day the whole army advances,
and the flag is planted on an ancient fortress,
where it never waved before. And even if
you never see this, better than inglorious
camp-following, is it to go in with the wasting
regiinent, to carry the colors up the scope of
the encmy's work, though the next moment
you fall at the foot of the glacis.
