WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE. 533

cession of works which constitute the crowning glory of English dramatic
literature.

“Shakespeare enjoyed the favor of Queen Elizabeth and James 1.,
and the friendship of Southampton, Raleigh‚ Ben Johnson, and other of
the principal of his contemporaries. After realizing an easy fortune by
his contributions to the stage, he retired to his native town. Shakes-
peare's tragedies of ίΗ3111131,’ ‘Macbeth,' ‘Othello‚' ‘Romeo and
Juliet‚’ and ‘King Lear‚' are wonderful exainples of his power of
expressing the strongest passions of the human soul3 while, on the other
hand, his comedies, particularly ‘The Merry Wives of Windsor‚’
‘Mueh Ado About Nothing,' ‘Twelfth Night,’ ‘The Taming of the
Shrew‚' eto, are unsurpassed in the English language. Of his (11311135,
strictly so-called‚ perhaps the finest are ‘As You Like It,' ‘The Merchant
of Veniee’ and ‘The Tempest.' ''

 

IMAGINATION.
FROM ss THE TEMPEST.”

NEVER may believe
These antique fabIes, nor these fairy toys.
Lovers and madmen have such seething
brains,
Such shaping fantasies that apprehend
More than 0001 reason ever comprehends.
The lunatio, the lover, and the poet
Are of imagination all eompact:
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold ;—

That is the madman : the lover, all as frantie,

Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt.

The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolhng,

Doth glanoe from heaven to earth, from earth
to heaven ;

And as imagination bodies forth

The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen

Turns them to shape, and gives to airy nothing

A local habitation, and 3 1131113.
