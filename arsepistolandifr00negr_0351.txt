DONALD GRANT MITCHELL.

cntly it cracks: you try to return, but it is
too late; then coines a sense of dizziness—a
succession of quick blows, and a dull, heavy
crash!

After this, come those long, weary days of
confinement, when you lie still, through all

303

the hours of noon, looking out upon the cheer-
ful sunshi11e‚ only through the windows of
your little room. Yet it seems a grand thing
to have the whole household attendant upon
you ; and when you groan with pain, you are
surc of meeting sad, sympathizing looks.

THE OLD SQUIRE.
FROM ιι1)11ΕΑΜ-1,11·«Ὲ.”

RANK has a grandfather living 111 the muse upon the time when some rich-lying

country, a good specimen of the old-

fashioned New England fai-mer. He
is a J ustice of the Peace, and many are the
country courts that you peep upon, with Frank,
from the door of the great dining-room. You
watch curiously the old gensseman, sitting in
his big arm—chair, with his spectacles in their
silver case at his elbow, and his snuff—box in
hand, listening attentively to some grievous
complaint; you see him ponder deeply—with
a pinch of snuff to aid his judgment‚—and
you listen with intense admiration, as he gives
a lond, preparatory “ Ahem‚'' and clears away
the intricacies of the case with a sweep of that
strong practica] sense which distinguishes the
N ew England farmer,—getting at the very
hinge of the matter, without any consciousness
of his own precision, and satisfying the de-
fendant by the clearness of his talk, as much

as by the leniency of his judgment.
He farms some fifteen hundred acres,—

“suitably divided,'' as the old-school agricul-
turists say, into “ woodland, pasture and till-
age.'’ The farm-house, a large irregularly
built mansion of wood, stands upon a shelf of
the hills looking southward, and is shaded by
century-old oaks. The barns and outbuild-
ings are grouped 111 11 brown phalanx a little
to the northward of the dwelling. Between
them a high timber gate opens upon the scat-
tered pasture-lands of the 111115. Opposite to
this, and across the farmyard, which is the
lounging-place of scores of red-necked turkeys,
and of matronly hens, clucking to their callow
brood, another gate of similar pretensions
opens upon the wide meadow—land.

So it is, that as you lie there upon the sunny
greensward, at the old Squire's door, you

land, with huge granaries and cozy old 1111111-
sion sleeping under the trees, shall be yours;
—when the brooks shall water your nieadows,
and come laughing down your pasture lands3
——when the clouds shall shed their spring fra-
grance upon your lawns, and the daisies bless
your paths.

You will then be a Squire, with your cane,
your lean-limbed hound, your stocking-leg of
specie, and your snuff-box. You will be the
happy and respected husband of some tidy old
lady in black and spectacles,—a little phthis-
icky, like Frank's grandmother‚—and an ac-
complished cook of stewed pears, and J ohnny-
cakes!

Being a visitor, and in the Squire's pew,
you are naturally an object of considerable
attention to the girls about your age; as well
as to a great many fat old ladies in iron spec-
tacles, who mortify you excessively by patting
you under the chin after church; and insist
upon mistaking you for Frank ; and force
upon you very dry cookies‚ spiced with cara·
way seeds.

The fariners you have a high respect for 3-—
particularly for one weazen-faced old gentle-
man in a brown surtout, who brings his whip
into church with him, who sings in a very
strong voice, and who drives a span of gray
colts. Another townsman, who attracts your
attention is a stout deacon, who before enter-
ing always steps around the corner of the
church and puts his hat upon the ground to
adjust his wig in a quiet way. In church you
innocently think how hypocritical it is in a
deacon to pretend to lean his head on his
hand when he 15 only holding on his wig, and
trying to hide his baldness
