He reminds us of his great ideal, Irving, but his subjects and

style are his ow‚n and his individuality, genial and attractive‚ appears in

THE GOUNTRY BOY.

FROM “ DREAM-LIFE. ’'

KNOW no 11011161· forage-ground for a ro—
mantio, venturesmne, mischievous boy,
than the garret of an old family mansion

on a day of storm. It is a perfect field of
chivalry. There is great fun in groping
through a tall harrel of books and pamphlets,
on the look-out for startling pictures; and
there are chestnuts in the gai-ret, drying,
which you have discovered on a ledge of the
chimney ; and you slide a few into your pocket,
and munch them quietly—giving now and
then one to Nelly‚ and begging her to keep
silent ;—for you have a great sear of its being
forbidden fruit.

Old family garrets have their stock, as I
said, of cast—away clothes, of twenty years
gone by; and it is rare sport to put them on ;
buttoning in a pillow or two for the sake of
good fuluess3 and then to triek out Nelly iu
some strange-shaped head-gear and old-fasir-
ioned brocadc pettieoat caught up with pins;
and in such guise, to steal cautiously down
stairs, and creep slyly into the sitting-room—
half afraid of a scoldiug, and very sure of
good sun ;-—tryi11g to look ver) sober, and yet
almost ready to die with 1116 laugh that you
know you will make. And your mother tries
10 10οκ harshly at little Nelly for putting ou
her giandmothcr's best bonnet; but Nelly’s
laughing eyes forbid it utterly, and the mother
spoils all her scolding with a perfect shower
of kisses.

After this, you go marching, very stately,
into the nursery; and utterly amaze the old
nurse; and make a deal of wonderment for
the staring‚ halfifrightencd baby, who drops
his rattle, and makes a bob at you, as if he
would jump into your waistcoat pocket.

You have looked admiringly many a day

upon 1116 tall sellows who play at the door of
Dr. Bidlow' 5 5611001;)011 have looked with

rev er.ence Dr. Bidlows 5661115 to you to belong
10 a race of giants3 and yet he is a spare, thiu
man, with a hooked nose‚ a large, ssat, gold
watch-key, a crack in his voice, a wag, and
very dirty wristbands.

You, however, come very little under his
control; you enter upon the proud life in the
small—boys' department—under the dominion
of the English master. He is a different per-
sonage from Dr. Bidlow ; he is a dapper, little
man, who twinkles his eye in a peculiar fash-
ion, and steps very springily around behind
the benehes, glancing now and then at the
books—cautioning one scholar about his dog’s
ears, and startling another from a doze by a
very lond and odious snap of his forefinger
upon the boy's head.

There are some tall trees that overshadow
an angle of the school-house: and the larger
scholars play surprising gymnastie tricks upon
their lower limbs.

In time, however, you get to performing
some modest experiments yourself upon the
very lowest li1nbs,-taking care to avoid the
observation of the larger boys, who else might
laugh at you : you especially avoid the notice
of one stout fellow in psa-green breecheS,
who is a sort of “ bully '’ among the small
bovs.

One day you are well in the tops of the
trees, and being dared by the boys below, you
venture higher—higher than any boy has

gone before. You feel very proud‚ 5ο you ad· ἱ·

vance cautiously out upon the limb: it bends
and sways fearfully with your weight3 pres-
