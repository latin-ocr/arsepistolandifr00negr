field of literature. Their writings are more distinctively :3
ὦ American—perhaps it would be more appropriate to say, West-

American. There is a breeziness about them—an off-hand ,Β

dash—a disregard of conventionalities which we do not discover '¹³
among such men as Irving, Bryant, Longfellow and others, who may be ᾇ
said to have created our literature and stamped it with their genius. ἰ]

Both fiction and poetry have taken on what may be called a new ,ἶ-
style. The aim to entertain, to present the humorous side of things, to ³
make a quick, even though superficial impression, is very apparent. It ¹,
would be unjust, however, to deny unusual merit to the new class of ᾗ.
authors. They are splendidly endowed. To brilliant native talent ’ἵ
many of them add great iudustry, a profound knowledge of human ,-
nature, and are able to discern what is demanded by the popular taste. ’Ὗ
They simply write as the time and the people require that they should.
While the writer helps to form national character, it is also true that the
national character helps to form him.

James Whitcomb Riley has been given the title of the “Hoosier
Poet of America.'’ This is partly owing to the State in which he had his
birth and where he has always resided. He was born in Greenfield, '⁷
Indiana, in 1852. In his boyhood he often accompanied his father, who
was an attorney, as he went fron] place to place transacting his business,
and thus early came into contact with the world, which has so much to do
with the education and development of the young mind. At an early age
he left home to follow the calling of a wandering sign-writer.

For a time he was connected with a theatrica] troupe, and showed
some aptitude for revising and adapting plays. He also began to show a
talent for song-writing and iinprovising lines on the spur of the moment,
thus indicating that he had a ready wit, and not merely the kind which

is studied up and manufactured for the occasion.
