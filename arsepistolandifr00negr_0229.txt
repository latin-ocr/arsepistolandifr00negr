FITZ-GREENE HALLECK.

An hour passed on-the Turk awoke:
That bright dream was his last ;
He woke—to hear his sentries shriek,

181

She wore no funeral weeds for thee,
Nor bade the dark hearse wave its plume,
Like torn branch from death's leaflless tree,

“To arms! they come! the Greek! the In son-ow’s pomp and pageantry‚

reek 1
Η6 111ἒ116-10 (116 1111(151 flame, and smoke,

And shout, and groan, and sabre-stroke‚
And death-shots falling thick and fast

As lightnings from the mountain-cloud ;

’ And heard, with voice as trum pet loud,
Bozzaris 611661 1115 band :

‘⁴ Strike—till the last armed foe expires ;

Strike-——for your altars and your fires ;

Strike——for the green graves of your sires,
God—-and your native land! '’

They fought—like brave men, long and

Thvgglbiled that ground with Moslem slain;

Α They conquered-—but Bozzaris fell
Bleeding at every vein.

His few surviving eomrades saw

His smile when rang their proud hurrah
And the red field was won 3

Then saw in death his eyelids close

Calmly, as to a night's repose‚
Like flowers 61 561 of sun.

Bozzaris! with the storied brave
Greeee nurtured in her glory’s time,

Rest thee-there is no prouder gave,
Even in her own proud elime.

The heartless luxury of the tomb.
But 5116 remembers thee as one
Long loved, and for a season gone.
For thee her poet’s lyre 15 wreathed,
Her marble wrought, her 11111516 breathed ;
For thee she rings the birthday bells ;
Of thee her babe's first lisping tells;
For thine her evening prayer is said
At palaee eoueh and cottage bed.
Her soldier, elosing with 1116 foe,
Gives for thy sake a deadlier blow ;
His plighted maiden, when 5116 fears
For him, 1116 joy of her young years,
Thinks of thy fate, and eheeks her tears.

And she, the mother of thy boys,
Though in her eye and faded eheek
Is read the grief she will not speak,
The memory of her buried joys—
And even she who gave 11166 birth,
Will, by her pilgrim-eireled hearth,
Talk of thy (loom without 6 sigh ;
For thou art freedom’s now, and fame’s—
One of the few, the immortal names
That were not born to die.

 

JOSEPH RODMAN DRAKE.

REEN be the turf above thee,
Friend of my better days!

N one knew thee but to love thee,
Nor named thee but to praise.

Tears fell when thou wert dying,
From eyes unused to weep,
And long, where thou art lying,

Will tears the cold turf steep.

When 1166115, whose truth was proven,
Like thine, are laid in earth,

There should a wreath be woven
To tell the world their worth ;

And I, who woke each morrow
To elasp thy hand in mine,

Who shared thy joy and sorrow,
Whose weal and woe were 1111116,-

Ι1 should be mine to braid it
Around thy faded brow,

But I've in vain essayed it,
And feel I cannot now.

While memory bids me weep thee,
Nor thought nor words are free,
The grief is fixed too deeply
That mourns 6 man like thee.
