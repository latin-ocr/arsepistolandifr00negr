JOAQUIN MILLER.

Rode we on, rode we three, rode we gray nose
and nose,

Reaching long, breathing lond, as a creviced

wind blows;

Yet we spoke not a whisper‚ we breathed not
a prayer,

There was work to be done, there was death
in the air,

And the chance was one to a thousand for all.

Gray nose to gray nose and each steady
mustang

Stretched neck and 51101011οᾰ 1101-110 1111 1110
hollow earth rang

And the foam from the flank and the croup

and the neck
Flew around like the spray on a storm-driven
Τπειῇῑοῗῇῃρεῑ thirty mnes 1-a dim distant
ThenSIaelszng reaching line and the Brazos in
Andsigiildse in my seat with a shout of delight.
I stood in my 51111111) and looked to my right,
But Revels was gone; Ι 8111110111 by my
shoulder
And saw his horse stagger; Ι saw his head

1110011111 8

Hard on his breasr, and his naked 1110051Ι

stooping
Low down to the mane 05 50 swifter and

Ran {glihing out for us the red-footed fire.

To right and to left the black buffalo came,
In miles and in millions, rolling on in despair,

With their beards to 1110 111151 and black tails
in the air.

As a terrible surf 011 0 1011 500 of flame
Rushing on in the rear, reaching high, reach-
ing higher,

And he rode neck to neck to a buffalo bull,
The monarch of millions‚ with shaggy mane
Of snfildllie and of 111151, 01111 11 shook with desire
Of battle, with rage and with bellowings loud
And unearthly, and up through its lowering
Camgltliledllash of his eyes like a half-hidden

fire,

 

261

While his keen crooked horns through the
storm of his mane

Like 111001( 1011005 lifted and lifted again3
And ἇηξϊὲξᾶ but this once, for the fire licked

And he fell and was lost, as we rode two and
two.

I looked to my left then, and nose, neck, and
shoulder

80111( Ι5101111117, sank surely, till back to my
t 11 ·

And 1111181111011811 1110 black blowing veil of her
1011

Did bean] full in mine her two marvelous eyes

With a longing and love, yet look of despair,

Andla pity for me, as she felt the smoke fold
101,

And flames reaching far for her glorious hair.

Her sinking steed faltered, his eager ears fell

To agudelfl'ro and unsteady‚ and all the neck's

Did 511111511ἀο and recede, and the nerves fell as
ea .

Then she saw that my own steed still lorded
his head

With a look of delight, for this Pache‚ you see,

&Vas her father's, and once at the South
Santafee

Had won a whole herd, sweeping everything
down

In a race where the world came to run for the
crown ;

And so when I won the true heart of my
bride-

My neighbor’s and deadliest enemy's child,

And child of the kin gly war-chief of his tribe—-

8110 brought me this steed to the 11011101 the
night

8110 met Revels and me in her 1101-110115 ssight,

From the lodge of the chief to the north
Brazos side3

And said, so half guessing of ill as 5110 smilcd

As ifjesting, that I, and Ι only, should ride

The fleet-footed Pache, so if kin should pursue

I should surely escape without other ado

Thau to ride, without blood, to the north
Brazos side,

And await her—and wait till the next hollow
moon
