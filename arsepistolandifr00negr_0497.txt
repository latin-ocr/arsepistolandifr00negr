The fawns in the ineadow-fields fearlessly play -
Away to the 6111136, lovely maiden, away!

Bound, bound to thy courser, the bison is near,
And list to the tramp of the light—footed deer.

Let England exult in her dogs and her chase—
O! what's a king’s park to this limitless space!
No fences 10 leap and 110 thickets to turn,
No owners to injure, no furrows 10 31111111.

But, softly as thine 011 1116 carpeted hall,

Is heard the light foot of the courser to fall ;
And close-matted grass no impression receives,
As ironless hoofs bound alost fron] the leaves.

O, fly to the prairie! the eagle is there:

He gracefully wheels in the cloud-speckled air
And, timidly hiding her delicate young,

The prairie-hen hushes her beautiful song.

O, fly to the prairie, sweet maideu, with 11161

The vine and the 111-1111161036 1110330111 sor 11166 ;

Α1111, hailing the moon in thc 1111111·16-111·111111611
sk ,
The mockjing-bird echoes 1116 katydid's cry.

Let Mexicans boast of their 1161113 and their
3166113,

The free prairie-hunter no 311611116111-111 »y needs z ,

The bisen, like clouds, overshadow the place,
And the wild, spotted 6111113613 invite to the
chase.

The former may boast of his grass and his
grain—-
He sows them in labor, and reaps 1116111 111 pain ;

But here the deep soil no exertion requires,
Enriched by the ashes, and cleared by the fires.

The woodman delights in 1113 trees aud his

shade;
But see there's no 31111 011 1116 6116611 of 1113
maid ;

, Η13 flowers are faded, his 1)]03301113 are pale,

And mildew is riding his vaporeus gale.

Then fly to the 1111111161 111 wonder there gaze,

As sweeps o'er the grass the 111 agnificent blaze,

The land 13 o'erwhelmed 111 1111 ocean of light,

11711036 {lame-surges break 111 1116 breeze of the
night.

Sublime frou] the north comes wind in 1113
wrath,

And scatters 1116 166113 111 his desolate path ;

Or, loaded with incense, steals in from the
west,

As bees froin 1116 111111116-1036 fly to their 11631.

(f), fly 10 1116 1111111161 for freedoin is there!

Love lights not that home with the torch of
despair 1

No wretch to entreat‚ and 111) lord to deny,

No gossips 10 3111111161, no neighbor to pry.

But, siruggling not there the heart's impulse
to ludo,

Love leaps 11116 the fount froin the crystal-rock
side,

And strong as its adamant, pure as its spring,

Waves wildly in sunheanis his rose-colored
wing.

RAIN ΟΝ THE ROOF.
BY COATEs KINNEY.

Wide popularity has attended 1116 following poem, which is the best-known 111-0110611011
of the author. He was born in 1826 near Penn Yan, N ew York‚ and was successively school-

teacher‚ journalist and lawyer.

HEN the humid shadows hover
Over all the starry spheres,
And the melancholy darkness
Gently weeps in rainy tears,
What a joy to press the pillow
Of a cottage chamber bed,
And to 1131611 10 1116 patter
Of the soft rain overhead!

29

Excery tinkle 011 1116 shingles
Has an echo 111 1116 heart3
And a thousand dreamy fancies
Into busy being start;
And a thousand recollections
Weave their bright hues into woof
As I listen to the patter
Of the rain upon the roof.
