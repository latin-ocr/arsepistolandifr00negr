EDMUND CLARENCE STEDMAN.

Poet and Man of Business

 

⁸· ἕξ TOCK-BROKER and poet—a combination so singular that we
„ have no other representative of it except Mr. Stedman. One
ῃ 4 can easily surmise that, being warned by the unhappy fate of
‘⁴¹⁴' many who have sought a livelihood as writers of verse, he
wisely chose to unite a lucrative business with poetic genius.
And so we have an example of the pen that signs bills and
checks writing lyrics and sonnets.

Mr. Stedman was brought into notice in 1859 by the publication in
the “ New York Tribune '' of a poem entitled “The Diamond Wedding‚''
which was a humorous thrust at a wealthy Cuban who lavished in an
ostentatious way gifts upon his bride who was a lady of New York. It
is said that the father of the lady was so enraged that he sent a challenge
to the poet, but for some reason the parties never met on the gory field.
Another poem entitled, “ How Old Brown took Harper's Ferry,'’ narrated
the exploits of this famous character at the beginning of our Civil War.

By these productions Mr. Stedman was favorably introduced to pub-
lishers, and in 1860 Charles Scribner issued a volume entitled “ PoemS,
Lyric and Idyllic‚'’ which gave the author a standing at once in the liter-
ary world. After a brief career of journalism in connection with a news-
paper at Norwich‚ Conn.‚ and another at Vllinsted in the same state, he
was connected with the “ New York Tribnne.'' At the beginning of the
war he became correspondent for the “New York World‚'' and gained
great distinction by writing a description of the first battle of Bull Run.

His next publication was a volume of poems entitled, “Alice of Mon-
mouth, an Idyll of the Great War‚ and other Poems.'' Other works fol-
lowed, and among these are “The Blameless Prince and other Poems‚''
18693 “Poetical XVorksss' 18733 “Victorian Poets‚’' 1875, which has been
pronounced Mr. Stedman’s best and most critical work3 “ Hawthorne and
other Poe1ns,'' 18773 “ Poems of Austin Dobson‚'' 18803 “ Poets of Amer-

ica,'‘ 1886, and with Ellen Mackay Hutchinson he edited a “ Library of

American Literature ’³ in eleven volumes.
