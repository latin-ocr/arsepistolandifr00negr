OmvsR WENDELL HOLMEs.

Poet and Humorist.

 

c} Ι ι’, ULTURED, genial, witty‚ unique Dr. Holmes—-sunshine in
s ¹2 “ every look and word—original in thinking and in expressing
ζ thought—equally at home in the realm of fancy and the realm
of philosophy.

No one will deny that the author of the “ Autocrat of the
B1·eakfast-Table,’' “Elsie Venner‚'' and such poems as “The
Chambered Nautilus ‘' and “The Deacon’s One-Hoss Shay ’‘ is worthy to
have his name written high among our literary celebrities.

Oliver Wendell Holmes is a son of the late Abiel Holmes, D.D., and
was born at Cambridge, Massachusetts, on the twenty-ninth day of
August, 1809. He received his early education at the Phillips Exeter
Academy, and entered Harvard University in 1825. On being graduated
he commenced the study of the law, but relinquished it, after one year's
applicati0n‚ for the more congenial pursuit of medicine, to which he ’
devoted himself with ardor and industry. For the more successful pro-
semnion of his studies, he visited Europe in the spring of 1833, passing
the principa] portion of his residence abroad at Paris, where he attended
the lwspitals, acquired an intimate knowledge of the language, and

became personally acquainted with many of the most eminent physicians
of Francc.

 

He returned to Boston near the close of 1835, aud in the following
spring commenced the practice of medicine in that city. In the autumn .
’of the same year he delivered a poem before the Phi Beta Kappa Society
of Harvard University, which was received with extraordinary and merited ’

applanse. ln 18 38 he was elected Professor of Anatonly and Physiology J
111 thc medical institution connected with Dartmouth College, but resigned
the place on his marriage, two years afterward.

Devoting all his attention to his profession, he soon acquired a large

and lucrative practice, and in 1847 he succeeded Dr. Warren as Professor J ’ξ

of Anatomy in the medical department of Harvard University. His prin-

cipal medical writings are comprised in his “ Boylston Prize Essays‚”
