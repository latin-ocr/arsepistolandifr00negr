GEORGE ELIOT.

back to tell you. There was no hindering it;
you must know.’'

He was silent, looking on the ground for
two long minutes. N ancy would have said
some words of comfort under this disgrace‚
but she refrained, from an instinctive sense
that there was something behind,—-that God-
frey had something else to tell her. Pre-
sently he lifted his eyes to her face, and kept
them fixed on her, as he said :

‘⁴ Everything comes to light, Nancy, sooner
or later. When God Almighty wills it, our
secrets are found out. I've lived with a
secret on my mind, but I’ll keep it from you
no longer. I wouldn't have you know it by
somebody else, and not by me——I wouldn't
have you find it out after I'm dead. I’ll tell
you now. It's been ‘I will’ and ‘I won't'
with me all my life; I’ll make sure of myself
now·''

Nancy’s utmost dread had returned. The
eyes of the husband and wife met with an
awe in them, as at a crisis which suspended
affection.

“Nancy,” said Godfrey slowly‚ “when Ι
married you, Ι hid something from you,—
something 1 ought to have told you. That
woman Marner found dead in the snow—
Eppie's mother—that wretched woman—was
my wife; Eppie is my child.’'

He paused, dreading the effects of his con-
fession. But Nancy sat quite still, only that
her eyes dropped and ceased to meet his.
She was pale and quiet as a meditative statue,
clasping her hands on her lap.

“ You'll never think the same of me again‚''
said Godfrey after a little while, with some
tremor in his voice. She was silent.

“I oughtn't to 'have left the child un-
owned ; I oughtn't to have kept it from you.
But I couldn’t bear to give you up, Nancy.
I was led away into marrying her; Ι suffered
for it.’'

Still Nancy was silent, looking down; and
he almost expected that she would presently
get up and say she would go to her father‘s.
How could she have any mercy for faults
that seemed so black to her, with her simple,
severe notions?

But at last she lifted up her eyes to his

again and spoke. There was no indignation
in her voice3 only deep regret.

“Godfrey, if you had told me this six
years ago, we could have done some of our
duty by the child. Do you think I’d have
refused to take her in, if I’d known she was
yours ‘?'’

At that moment Godfrey felt all the bitter-
ness of an error that was not simply futile,
but had defeated its own end. He had not
measured this wife with whom he had lived
so long. But she spoke again, with more
agitation.

“ And—oh, Godfrey—if we'd had her from
the first, if you’d taken to her as you ought,
she'd have loved me for her mother—and
you’d been happier with me ; Ι could better
have bore my little baby dying, and our life
might have been more like what we used to
think it 'ud be.”

The tears fell, and N ancy ceased to speak.

“ But you wouldn‘t have married me then,
N ancy, if I'd told you,” said Godfrey, urged,
in the bitterness of his sels-reproaoh, to prove
to himself that his conduct had not been
utter folly. “You may think you would
now, but you wouldn’t then. With your
pride and your father's, you’d have hated
having anything to do with me after the
talk there’d been.''

“I can’t say what I should have done
about that, Godfrey. Ι should never have
married anybody else. But Ι wasn’t worth
doing wrong for; nothing is in this world.
Nothing is so good as it seems beforehand;
not even our marrying wasn’t, you see.''
There was a faint, sad smile on Nancy's face
as she said the last words.

“I’m a worse man than you thought Ι was,
Nancy‚'' said Godfrey rather tremulously.
“ Can you forgive me ever? ”

“The wrong to me is but little, Godfrey.
You've made it up to me; you've been good
to me for fifteen years. It's another you did
the wrong to; and Ι doubt it can never be all
made up for.'’

“ But we can take Eppie now,” said God-
frey. “I won't mind the world knowing at
last. I'll be plain and open for the rest o’
my life.’'
