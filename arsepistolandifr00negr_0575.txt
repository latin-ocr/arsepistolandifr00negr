SIR WALTER SCOTT. 527

ing the various characters so that the reader almost imagines he sees
thern before his eyeS, Scott may be said to be without a rival. His works
have had a phenomenal popularity.

Of delicate health in early life, he slowly advanced to a sturdy man-
hood, and became distinguished as an author at a period comparatively
late. Perhaps no other author ever wrote so much when past the age of
fifty-five. It is honorable to the memory of Scott that a large amount of
his literary work was undertaken and carried forward for the purpose of
meeting a pecuniary obligation. “ Waverly '' took the world by storm,
and Scott who did not acknowledge the authorship, might well suppose
he had found the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

As a writer it is a truism to say that, since Shakespeare‚ whom he
resembled in many ways, there has never been a genius so human and so
creative, so rich in humor, sympathy, poetry, so fertile in the production
of new and real characterS, as the genius of Sir Walter Scott. “The Lay
of the Last Minstrel,’' and “The Lady of the Lake,'' hold high rank in
the realm of poetry and are full of life and spirit. They are colored by
the romanoe of Scottish history and Scottish scenery. For a long time
Scott resided at Abbotsford, a few miles from Edinburgh‚ which was one
of the famous places to visit by all tourists in Scotland.

“BREATHES THERE THE MAN.”

REATHES there the man with soul so High though his titles, proud his name,
defid- ’ Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,
Who never to himself hath said,
This is my own, my native land 1
Whose heart bath ne'er within him burned,
As home his footsteps he hath turned

Despite those titles, power, and pelf,

The wretch‚ concentrated alliu sels,
Living, shall forfeit fair renown,

From wandering on a foreign strand ! And> dOUbly dying, Shall 30 dOWU
If such there breathe, go mark him well 3 To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
For him no minstrel raptures swell ; Unwept, unhonored, and unsung.

BATTLE OF· FLODDEN.

HE English shafts in volleys hassed, Though charging knights like whirl winds go
In headlong charge their horse assaileth Though bill-men ply the ghastly blow,
F ront, flank, and rear, the sqnadrons Unbroken was the 1·ing;
swept, The stubborn spearsmen still made good
To break the Scottish circle deep, Their dark impenetrable wood,
That fought around their King. Each stepping where his comrade stood,
But yet, though thick the shafts as snmv, The instant that he fell.
