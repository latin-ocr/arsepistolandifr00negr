MARTHA F INLEY.

book? There will be no ride for you this
morning. You have failed in everything.
Go to your seat. Make that example right,
and do the next; learn your geography lesson
over, and write another page in your copy-
book; and mind, if there is a blot on it, you
will get no dinner.”

Weeping and sobbing, Elsie took up her
books and obeyed.

During this scene Arthur stood at his desk
pretending to study, but glancing every now
and then at Elsie, with a conscience evidently
ill at ease. She cast an imploring glauce at
him, as she returned to her seat; but he
turned away his head, muttering, “ It's all
her own fault, for she wouldn’t let me help
her.'’

As he looked up again, he caught his sister
Lora's eyes fixed on him with an expression
of scorn and contempt. He colored violently,
and dropped his upon his book.

“Miss Day,’' said Lora, indignantly‚ “ Ι
See Arthur does not mean to speak, and as Ι
cannot bear to see such injustice‚ Ι must tell
you that it is all his fault that Elsie has failed
in her lessons3 for she tried her very best,
but he teased her incessantly, and also jogged
her elbow and made her spill the ink on her
l)ook; and to her credit 5116 was too honorable
to tear out the leaf from her copy book, or to
let him make her example right; both which
he very generously proposed doing after caus-
ing all the mischief.’'

“ Is this so, Arthur ⁶? '’ asked Miss Day,
angrily.

The boy hung his head but made no reply.

“Very well, then,’' said Miss Day, “ you
too must stay at home.''

“Surely,’' said Lora, in surprise, you will
not keep Elsie, since Ι have shown you that
she was not to blame.''

“ Miss Lora‚'’ replied her teacher, haughtily,
“ Ι wish you to understand that Ι am not to
be dictated to by my pupils.''

Lora bit her lip, but said nothing, and Miss
Day went on hearing the lessons without
further remark.

In the meantime little Elsie sat at her
desk, striving to conquer the feelings of anger
and indignation that were swelling in her

breast3 for Elsie, though she possessed much
of “ the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit‚''
was not yet perfect, and often had a fierce
contest with her naturally quick temper.

The recitations were scarcely finished when
the door opened and a lady entered, dressed
for a ride.

“Not through yet, Miss Day? ’' she asked.

“Yes, madam, we are just done,'' replied
the teacher, closing the French grammar and
handing it to Louise.

“WelL Ι hope your pupils have all done
their duty this morning, and are ready to ac-
company us to the fair,'' said Mrs. Dinsmore.
‘⁶ But what is the matter with Elsie? ''

“She has failed in all her exercises, and
therefore has been told that she must remain
at home,'' replied Miss Day with heightened
color and in a tone of anger; “and as Miss
Lora tells me that Master Arthur was partly
the cause, Ι have forbidden him also to ac-
company us.''

“ Excuse me, Miss Day, for correcting you,’'
said Lora, a little indignantly; ‘⁴ but I did not
say partly, for Ι am sure it was entirely his
fault.’'

“ Hush, hush, Lora‚’' said her mother, a lit-
tle impatiently; “how can you be sure of any
such thing3 Miss Day, I must beg of you to
excuse Arthur this once, for Ι have quite set
my heart on taking him along. He is fond
of mischief, l know, but he is onlya child.”

“ Mainma,'' asked Lora, “is not Elsie to be
allowed to go too? ''

“ Elsie is not my child, and I have nothing
to say about it. Miss Day, who knows all the
circumstances, is much better able than Ι to
judge whether or no she is deserving of pun-
ishment,'' replied Mrs. Dinsmore‚ sailing out
of the room.

“ You will let her go, Miss Day? ’' said
Lora, inquiringly.

“ Miss Lora,'' replied Miss Day, angrily,
“ Ι have already told you Ι was not to be dic-
tated to. Ι have said Elsie must remain at
home, and Ι shall not break my word.’'

“Such injusticel '' muttered Lora, turning
awa r.

hfiss Day hastily quitted the room, followed
by Louise and Lora, and Elsie was left alone„⁸
