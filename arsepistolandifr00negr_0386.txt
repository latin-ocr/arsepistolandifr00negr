with him to reside in Boston. In 18 3 5 she gathered into a work entitled
“ The Corona] ’' a number of miscellaneous pieces which had been pub-
lished before. In the same year she embarked in the great agitation on
the slavery question which was then in its infancy, and issued her
“Appeal for that Class of Americans Called Africans.'' Her powerful
pen was often employed afterward in the cause 5116 thus early espoused.
What 15 thought by many 10 be her most beautiful work, namely‚
“ Philothea, a Romance of Greece in the Days of Pericles,'' was published

fame. In 1841 Μ15. Child went with her husband to reside in New York
and there conducted for some time “ The National Anti-Slavery Standard.’'
She was a conspicuous and admired figure among the foremost thinkers
and reformers of her time. Having resided in New York many years,
she died there October 20, 1880, in the seventy-eighth year of her age.
Mrs. Child was a most industrious and voluminous author. Besides
the works already referred to she wrote “ Flowers for Children‚'’ three
volumeS, 1844—18463 “Fact and Fiction,'' 18463 “The Power of Kind-
ness‚’' 1851 3 ‘⁴ A True Life of Isaac P. Hopper,’' 1853 3 “ Autumnal
Leaves,'' 18563 ‘⁶ Looking Toward Sunset‚'' 18643 “The Freedman's
Book,'' 18653 “Maria,'’ 18673 and “Aspirations of the World,'' 1878,
which was the last work of her long and busy life—issued just three
years before her death. ln 1882, two years after her demise‚ a volume

of her letters was published with an introduction by the poet Whittier‚
and an appendix by Wendell Phillips.
