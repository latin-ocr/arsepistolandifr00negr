JOHN GODFREY SAXE.

Humorous Poet.

OHN GODFREY SAXE, of Highgate, Franklin county, Ver-
mont, was born in that town on the second day of June, 1816.
His youth was passed in rural occupations, until he was seven· ,
teen years of age, when he determined to study one of the
liberal professions, and with this view entered the grammar
school at St. Albans, and after the usual preliminary course,

the college at Middlebury, where he graduated bachelor of arts in the

summer of 1839. He subsequently read law, at Lockport in New York
aud at St. Albans, and was admitted to the bar at the latter place, in ·

September, 1843.
“ Ι remember,'' says a friend, “that when Mr. Saxe was in college

 

he was well known for his manly character, good sense, genial humor, '2
and, for an undergraduate, large acquaintance with literature. Besides l
writing with such delightful point and facility, he is one of the best of
conversationists, aud wastes more wit in a day than would set up a Yan-
kee ‘Puuch' or a score of ‘Yankee Doodles.’ He is a good general
scholar, well read in the best English authors, and besides his comical
compositions, has produced many pieces of grace and tenderness that
evince a genuine poetical feeling and ability.'’

Mr. Saxe excels most iu fun, burlesque, and satire, fields upon the

confines of the domain of poetry, in which we have many of the finest
specimens of lyrical expression, and which have furnished, from the times t}

 

of Juvenal, a fair proportion of the noblest illustrations of creative energy.
His verse is nervous, and generally highly finished; and in almost all
cases it is admirably calculated for the production of the desired effects. (ἢ
Γ he longest of his productions is “Progress, a Satire,'' which has
passed through several editions, and been largely quoted for its felicitous i
characterization of popular foiblcs His‘ New Rape of the Lock,''writ-1
ten in 1847, and “ Proud Miss MacBride, '' written in 1848, are in the vein f

of Hood, but are full of verbal felicities and humor.
