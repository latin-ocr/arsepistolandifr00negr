TO MARY IN HEAVEN.
THOU lingering star, with lessening ray, Ayr, gurgling, hissed 1115 pebbled shore,

That lov'st to greot the early morn, O'erhung with wild woods‚ thickening green
Again thou 1151161651 111 1116 day The fragrant birol1, and hawthorn hoar,
My Mary from my 50111 was torn. Twined amorous round the raptured scene.
Oh, Mary! deur departed shade! The flowers sprung wauton to be pressed‚
Where 15 thy place of blissful rest? The birds sung love on every spray,
Sec'st thou thy lover lowly laid? Till too, too soon, the glowing west

Hem-‘st thou 1116 groans that rend his breast? Proclaimed the speed of winged day.

That sacred 110111· can Ι f=›rget? Still o’er these soenes my memory wakes, ¹
Gan Ι forget the hallowed grove And fondly broods with miser care3
W here hy the winding Ayr we met Time but the impression deeper makes,
To live one (lay of parting love? As streams their channels deeper wear.
Etcrnity will not effaoe My Mary! dear departed shade!
Those 16601115 116111 of transports past! Where 15 thy place of blissful rest?
Thy image at our last ennbrace— See'st thou thy lover lowly laid?

Ah 1 little thought we ’twas our last ! Hear'st thou the groans that rend his breast?
