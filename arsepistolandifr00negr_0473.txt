How they shouted! What rejoieing!
How the old bell shook the air,

Till the clang of freedom ruffled,
The calmly gliding Delaware!

How the bonfires and the 10101103

That old State House bell is silent,
Hushed is now its elamorous tongue ς
But the spirit it awakencd

And when we greet the smiling sunlight
On the fourth of each J uly,
We will ne'er forget the bellman

THE. PHILOSOPHER TOAD.
BY MRs. REBECCA s. NICHOLs.

DOWVN deep in a hollow, so damp and so Down deep in that hollow the bees never come,

eold‚
VVhere oaks are by ivy o’ergrown,
The gray moss and liehen ereep over the mould,
Lying loose on a ponde rous stone.
Now within this huge stone, like a king on his
throne, [known 3
A toad has been sitting more years than is
And strange as it seems, yet 110 constanty
deems [his (11001113-
The world standing still while he’s dreaming
Does this wonderful toad, in his eheerful
abode
In the innermost heart of that flinty old stone,
By the gray-haired moss and the lichen o'er-
grown.

Down deep in the hollow, from morning till
night,

Dun shadows glide over the ground, ssight,
WVhere a wateroourse once, as it sparkled with
Turned a ruined old mill-wheel around :
Long years have passed by since its bed be-

came dry, [of the sky
And the trees grow so close, soaree a glimpse
Is seen in the hollow, so dark and so damp,
Where the glow-worm at noonday is trimming
his lamp,
And hardly a sound from the thieket around‚
WVhere the rabbit and squirrel leap over the
ground,

Is heard by the toad in his spaeious abode
In the innermost heart of that ponderous stone,
By the gray-haired 111033 and the lichen o’er-

grown.

The shade is too blaok for a fl‹›wer ; [hu1n,
And jewel-winged birds, with their musical
Never flash in the night of that bower;
But the oold-blooded snake, in the edge of the
brake, [awake ;
Lies amid the rank grass half asleep, half
And the ashen—white snail, with the 3111110 111
113 trail,
Moves wearily on like a life's tedious tale,
Yet disturbs 1101 1110 toad 111 1113 spacious
abode,
In the innermost heart of that flinty old stone,
By the gray-haired 111033 and the lichen o’er-
grown.

Down deep in a hollow some wiseacres sit
Like the toad in his cell in the stone ;
Around them in daylight the blind owlets flit,
And their oreeds are with ivy o’ergrown—
Their streams may grow dry, and the wheels
cease to ply,
And their glimpses be few of the sun and the
sky, [ored guest,
Still they hug to their breast every time-hon-
And sluinber and doze in inglorious rest ;
For no progress they find 111 1110 wide sphere of
mind, [kind ;
And the world’s standing still with all oftheir
Contented to dwell deep down 111 1110 well,
Or move like the snailin the crust of his shell,
Or live like the toad in his narrow abode‚
With their souls closely wedged in a thick wall

of stone, [grown.
By the gray weeds of prejudioe rankly o’er-
