GEoRoE DENISON PRENTmE.

Poet and Journalist.

³⁹55 *ssa REAT beauty characterizes the poems of this gifted author,
⁴ ᾖ while in strong contrast with it his brilliant witticisms have
made him famous. These qualities are not often found in one
writer, but Mr. Prentice combines them to their fullest extent.
His witticisms were thrown off daily in his long career of jour-
nalism, while his poems were mostly written in early life before
he left the University.

George D. Prentice was born at Preston‚ Connecticut, in 1802, and
graduated at Brown University in 1823. He founded “The New Eng-
land Review'’ in 1828, and on this periodica] was associated for a time
with John G. Vv'hittier. In 1831 he became the editor of the “ Louisville
Journal ’' in Kentucky‚ which soon acquired the reputation of one of the
ablest and most brilliant journals of the country. A collection of his

humorous writings, entitled “ Prenticeana,'’ appeared in 1860. Η5 (115(1

WRITTEN AT MY MOTHER'S GRAVE.
HE trembling dew-drops fall And Ι 1111151 linger here,

Upon the shutting flowers; like souls at rest To stain the plumage of my 51111555 years,
The stars shine gloriously3 and all And mourn the hopes to childhood deal·
Save me, 515 111551. With bitter 15515.
Mother, I love thy grave! Ay, I must linger here,
The violet, with its blossoms blue and mild‚ A lonely branch upon a withered tree,
Waves o’er thy head; when shall it wave Whose last frail leaf, untimely sere,
Above thy child? Went down with thee!
’T is 5 sweet flower‚ yet must Oft, from life’s withered bower,
Its bright leaves to the coming tempest bow ; In still communion with the past, I turn,
Dear mother, 't 15 1111115 emblem ; dust And muse on thee, the only flower
Is on thy brow. In memory's urn.
And I could love to die: And, when the evening pale
To leave untasted life's dark‚ bitter streams— Bows, like a mourner, on the dim, blue wave,
By thee, as 5151 111 childhood‚ lie, Ι stray to hear the night-winds wail
And share thy (11551115. Α1·01111(1 thy grave.
