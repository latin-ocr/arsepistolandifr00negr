Closer nestle,
Dealest, to my side,
What enchantmvnt, in our magio vessel
Thus to glide,
Making musio, ou a silver tide!

Jingle! jingle!
How the fields go by!
Earth and air in snowy sheen commingle,
Fur and nigh ;
Is the ground beneath us, or the sky?

. Heavenward yonder
In the lurid north,

EDMUND CLARENCE STEDMAN.

From Valhalla's gates that roll asunder.
Red und wroth.

Balder’s funeral flames are blazing forth.

Ο, what splendor!
How the hues expire!
All the elves of light their tribute render
To the pyre,

Clad in robes of gold and crimson fire.

Jingle! jingle!
Let- the earth go by ἔ

With a wilder thrill our pulses tingle;

You and I

Will shout our loves, but aye forget to sigh.

KEARNEY AT SEVEN PINES.
[MARCH 31, 1862]

O that soldierly legend is still on its jour· How he strode his brown steed!

ney—
That story of Kearney who knew not to
yield l
’Twas a day when with J ameson, fierce Berry,
and Birney,
Against twenty thousand he rallied the field,
there the red volleys poured, where the
clamor rose highest,

there the dead lay in olumps through the

dwarf oak and pine‚
VVhere the aim from the thieket was surest
and nighest—
No charge like Phil Kearney's along the
whole line.

XVhen the battle went ill, and the bravest
were solemn,
Near the dark Seven Pines, where we still
held our ground,
He rode down the length of the withering
column,
And his heart at our war-cry leapt up with
a bound ;
He snuffed, like his charger, the wind of our
powder-

His sword waved us on and we answered ’

the sion :
Loud our ehteer as we rushesl, but his laugh
rang the louder,
“There’s the devil's own fun, boys, along
the whole line! ’²

How we
saw his blade brighten
In the one hand still left—and the reins in
his teeth ἔ
He laughed like a boy when the holidays
heighten,
But a soldier’s glanee shot from his visor
beneath.
Up came the reserves to the mellay infernal,
Asking where to go in——through the clear-
ing or pine‘?
“ O, anywhere! Forward! ’T is all the same,
Colone] ε

You’ll find lovely fighting along the whole
line 1 ’³

O, evil the blaek sliroud of night at (fh-antilly,
That hid him from sight of his bravo meu
and tried 1
Foul, foul sped the bullet that clippei} the
white lily,
The flower of our knighthood, the whole
army’s pride!
Yet we dream that he still—-in that shadowy
reg-lon
XVhere the dead form their ranks at the
wan drummer's sign—
Rides on, as of old, down the length of his
legion,
And the word still is Forward! along the
whole line.
