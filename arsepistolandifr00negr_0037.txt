HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW. 19

rank among the immortals, notably the “ Ρ531111 of Life,‘' and “The
Reaper and the Flowers,'' with its mate, “ Footsteps of Angels.’'

In 1841 came another cluster of poems which have attained great fame,
and appear even at that early age to have been as fully marked with his
genius as any of his subsequent writingS. Longfellow was married to
his second wife, Miss Frances E. Appleton, of Boston‚ in 1843. He es-
tablished his home after his second marriage in the ‘⁶ Revolutionary
House ’' built early in the eighteenth century and used as headquarters
by Washington when he assumed command of the American army 111
1775. Here he resided for the most part to the end of his life. The
house, a picturesque mansion, was set 111 the midst of a spacious lawn
adorned with glorious old elms, while the great memories of the place
made it a sacred shrine in the estimation of all true Americans.

The poet continued his literary work in connection with his profes-
sorship, and at regular intervals issued such productioris as added to his
growing fame. The year 1847 witnessed the production of his most per-
fect poem, “ Evangeline,'' a tale which has been almost universally read
and has been received with great favor. A more delightful idyl has not
been given to English verse than this exquisite creation. Take, for in·

stance, these words :

“ Silently 0110 by 0110 in the infinite meadows of heaven,
Blossomed the lovely star-s, the forget-me-uots of the angels.”

In 1849 Longfellow published “ Kavanagh,’' a novel; also a small
volume of poems‚ “The Seaside and the Fireside.’' In this volume ap-
pears the poem, “Resignation‚” which is one of the gems of our lan-
guage. In 1851 “The Golden Legend '' appeared, a poem abounding in

beautiful passageS. He resigned his professorship in 1854, and in the
following year brought out “ The Song of Hiawatha‚'' in which he sang
the legends of the North American aborigines. This was followed in
1858 by “ The Courtship of Miles Standish,'' which proved as successful
as anything our poet had created.

The outbreak of the Civil XVar and the tragedy of his wife’s death
by the accident of a burning dress in her own home served for a time to
silence his muse. Having recovered somewhat from the terrible shock,
his gifted pen was again employed and so continued until the time of his
death, which occurred at Cambridge, Mass, March 24, 1882. Some of
his later productions are “New England Tragedies'' (1868); “The Di-
