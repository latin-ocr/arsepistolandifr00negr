THOMAS BAILEY ALDRICH.

And yet 'twas sweet to dream of her, to think
her wavy tresses
Might rest, some happy, happy day, like
sunshine on my cheek ;
The idle winds had fanned my brow I dreamed
were her earesseS‚
And in the robin's twitterings Ι heard my
sweetheart speak.

The silken fringes of her eyes upon her oheeks
were drooping,
Her meroiless white fingers tore a blushing
bud apart;
Then, quick as lightning, Kathie came and
kneeling half and stooping,
She hid her bonnie, bonnie face against my
beating heart.

Oh nestle, nestle,nestle there! the heart would
give thee greeting;
Lie thou there, all trustfully, in trouble
and in pain ;
This breast shall shield thee from the storm,
and bear its bitter beating ;
These arms shall hold thee tenderly in sun-
shine and in rain 1

Old Sexton, set your chimes in tune, and let
there be no snarling,
Ring out the happy wedding hymn to all
the listening air ;
And, girIS, strew roses as she comes—the

seornful, brown—eyed darling,
A princess, by the wavy gold and glisten-
ing of her hair.

Har-k! hear the bells! The Christmas bells 1
oh, 1103 who set them ringing?
Ι, think I hear our bridal bells, and I with
joy am blind—
Johnny, don⁷t make such a noisel
the robins singing,
And the petals of the apple-blooms are
ruffied in the wind.

I hear

Ah! Kathie, you've been true to me in fair
and eloudy weather ;
Our Father has been good to us when we’ve
been sorely tried ;
Ι pray to God,when we must die, that we
may die together,
And slumber softly underneath the clover,
side by side.

 

THE FAOE AGAINST THE PANE.

ABLE, little Mable,

With face against the pane,
Looks out across the night
And sees the Beaeon light

A-trembling in the rain.

She hears the sea-birds sereeeh,
And the breakers on the beaeh
Making moan, making moan.
And the wind about the eaves
Of the eottage sobs and grieves3
And the willow—tree is blown

To and fro, to and fro,
Till it seems like some old erone

Standing out there all alone,
With her woe,
Wringing, as she stands,
Her gaunt and palsied hands!
While Mable, timid Mable,
With face against the pane,
Looks out across the night,

 

And sees the Beaeon Light
A-trembling in the rain.

Set the table, maiden Mabel,
And make the eabin warm ;
Your little fisher-lover
Is out there in the storm,

And your father—you are weeping !
O Mabel, timid Mabel,
Go spread the supper-table,
And set the tea a-steeping.
Your lover's heart is brave;
His boat is stauneh and tight,
And your father knows the perilous reef
T hat makes the water white.
—But Mable, darling Mable,
With face against the pane,
Looks out across the night
At the Beacon in the rain.
