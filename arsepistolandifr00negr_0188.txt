I called on him, as on other leading members
of Congress, to explain the effect of the absurd
policy then iu vogue of keeping minei-al lands
out of market, and attempting to collect a
percentage of the mineral as rent accruing to
the Government.

THE PRESS. Ἴ
LONG slumbered the worldin the darkness Then hail to the Press! chosen guardian of Ἴ

of error,
And ignorance brmded o’er earth like
a pall;
To the sceptre and crown men abased them iu
terror,
Though galling the hondage, and bitter the
thrall3
When a voice, like the earthquake’s revealed
the dishonor—
A flash, like the lightning's unsealed every
eye,
-And o’er hill-top and glen floated liberty’s
banner,
While round it men gathered to conquer or
dle!

’Twas the voice of the Press, on the startled
ear breaking,
In giaut-born p1·oweSS‚ like Pallas of olsl;
Twas the flash of intelligence, gloriously wak-
mg
A glow on the cheek of the noble and bold;
And tyranny’s minions, o'erawed and af-
frighted‚
Sought a lasting retreat from its powerful
control,
And the chains which bound nations in ages
benighted.
lVere east to the haunts of the bat and the
mole.

Freedoin!
Strong sword-arm of justice! bright sun·
beam of truth ;
We pledge to her cause (and <she has but to
need them),
The strength of our manhood‚ the fire of -
our youth ;
Should despots e’er dare to impede her free
soaring,
Or bigot to fetter her flight with his chain,
We pledge that the earth shall close o’er our
deploring,
Or view her in gladness aud freedom again. ,

But no l—to the day-dawn of knowledge and

A fiiglloliyriighter noontide—refulgence suc· Ψ
And ouer-eea& shall embaIm, through all ages,
in story,

Her champion who triumphs—her martyr
who bleeds,
And proudly her sons shall recall their devo-
XVhilteOilnillions shall listen to honor and
Till theeleeslSJhrsts a response from the heart's
strong emotion‚
And the earth echoes deep with “ Long Life
to the Press ! ''
