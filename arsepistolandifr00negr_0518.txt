ALFRED TENNYSON.

Than that earth should stand at gaze like
Joshua's moon iu Ajalon!

Not in vain the distance beaeonS. For-ward,
sorward let us range;

Let the great world Spin forever down the
ringing grooves of change.

Through the shadow of the globe we sweep
into the younger day: ⁷

Better fistylv years of Europe than a eycle of
Cat my.

Mamer-Age (for mine I knew not) help me

ltin 1116 111115, and roll the waters, flash the
lightning& weigh the Sun ;—

Ancient fonnis of inspiration well through all
my fancy yet.

Howsoovvr 111656 things be, a long farewell to
L‹=ckslcy Hall!

Now for me the woods may wither, now for
me the roof tree f2.1ll

Comes a vapor from the margin, blackeningl
over heath and holt,

Craniming all the blast before it, in its breast
a thunderbolt.

111-1 it fall on Locksley Hau, with rain 01·-
hail, or fire or snow;

Ι For 1116 mighty wind arises‚ roaring seaward,

and 1 go,

 

SONG OF THE BROOK.

COME from 1111111115 of coot and hern ;

Ι make a sudden sully,
And spnrkle out among the feru,
To bicker down a valley.

By thirty hills Ι hurry down,
Or slip between 1116 ridgcs;
By twenty 11101115, a little town,

And half a hundred bridgeS.

Till 11151 by Philip’s farm I fiow
To join the brimming river;

For men may come and men may go,
But I go on forever.

I chat-ter over stony ways,

In little sharps and trebles3
I bubble into eddying bays,

Ι babble on the pebbles.

With many a curve my banks 1 fret
By many a field and fal-low,

And many a fairy foreland set
With willow-weed and mallow.
