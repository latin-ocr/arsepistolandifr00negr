Does not the New world clothe his form with
her palm groves and savannahs as fit drapery?
Ever does natural beauty steal in like air and
envelop great actions, When Sir Harry Vane
was dragged up the Tower-hill, sitting on a
sled, to suffer death as the champion of the
English lam, one of the multitude cried out
to him, ‘· Yon never sate on so glorious a seat.’'
Charles IL, to intimidate the citizens of Lon-
don, caused the patriot Lord Russell to be
drawn in an open coaeh through the principal
streets of the city on his way to the seaffold.

saw liberty and virtue sitting by his side.”
In private placeS, among sordid objects, an
act of truth or heroism seems at once to draw
to itself the sky as its temple, the sun as its
candle. Nature stretcheth out her arms to
embrace man, only let his thoughts be of equal
greatness Willingly does she follow his steps
with the rose and the violet, and bend her
lines of grandeur and grace to the decoration
of her darling child. Only let his thoughts
be of equal scope, and the frame will suit the
picture. A virtuous man is in unison with

THE THINKER.

HAT is the hardest task in the world?

To think. Ι would put myself in

the attitude to look in the eye of an

abstract truth, and Ι cannot. I blench and
withdraw on this side and that. I seem to
know what he meant, who said, “ No man can
see God face to face, and live.’' For example,
a man explores the basis of civil government.
Let him intend his mind without respite, with-
out rest, in one direction. His best heed long
time avails him nothing. Yet thoughts are
flitting before him. We all but apprehend,
we dimly forebode the truth. We say, Ι will
walk abroad, and the truth will take form
and clean-ness to me. We go forth, but ean-
not find it. It seems as if we needed. only

 

the stillness and composed attitude of the
library, to seize the thought.

But we come in, and are as far from it as
at first. Then, in amoment, and unannouneed
the truth appears. A certain wandering light
appears, and is the distinction, the principle,
we wanted. But the oracle comes, because we
had previously laid siege to the shrine. It
seems as if the law of the intelleet resembles
that law of nature by which we now inspire,
now expire, the breath by which the heart
now draws in, now hurls out the blood: the
law of undulation. So now you must labor
with your hrains, and now you must forbear

your aetivity, and see what the great soul
showeth.

THE POWER OF LOVE.

' HE passion remakes the world for the
Γ youth. lt makes all things alive and
significant. Nature grows conscious.
Every bird on the boughs of the tree sings now
to his heart and soul. Almost the notes are
articulate. The clouds have faces, as he looks
on them. The trees of the forest, the waving
grass and the peeping flower have grown
intelligent; and almost he fears to trust them
with the secret which they seem to invite.
Yet nature soothes and sympathizes. In the
green solitude he finds a dearer home than
with men.

‘⁴ Fountain heaps and pathless groves,
Places which pale passion loves,
Moonlight walks, when all the fowls
Are safely housed, save bats and owls,
A midnight bell, a passing grean,
These are the sounds we seed upon.’'

Behold there in the wood the fine madmanl

He is the palaee of sweet sounds and sights;
he dilates; he is twice a man; he walks with

arms akimbo; he soliloquizes; he accosts the
grass and the trees; he feels the blood of the
