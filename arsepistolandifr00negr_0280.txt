THOMAS BAILEY ALDRICH.

The heavens are veined with fire!
And the thunder, how it rolls!
In the lullings of the storin
The solemn church-bcll tolls
For lost souls !
But no sexton sounds the knell
In that belfry old and high3
Unseen fingers sway the bell
As the wind goes tearing by!
How it tolls for the souls
Of sailors on the sea !
God pity them, God pity them,
VVherever they may bc!
God pity wives and sweethearts
Who wait and wait in vain!
And pity little Mabel‚
With face against the pane.

A boom !—the Lighthouse gun!

(How its echo rolls and rolls 1)

’Tis to warn the home-bound ships
Off the shoals 1

See ! a rocket cleaves the sky
From the Fort—a shast of light !

See! it fades, and, fading, leaves
Golden furrows on the night!

What made Mable's cheek so pale?
What made Mabel's lips so white?

Did she see the helpless sail
That, tossing here and there,
Like a feather in the air,

Went down and out of sight?
Down, down, and out of sight!
Oh, watch no more, no more,
With face against the pane ;
You cannot see the men that drown
By the Beacon in the rain 1

From a shoal of richest rubies ,
Breaks the morning clear and cold, ;’
And the angel on the village spire,
Frost-touched‚ is bright as gold,
Four ancient fishermen,
In the pleasant autumn air,
Come toiling up the sanda,
With something in their hands—
Two bodies stark and white,
Ah, so ghastly in the light,
With sea-weed in their hair!

O ancient fishermen,
Go up to yonder cotl
You'll find a little child,
With face against the pane,
Who looks toward the beach,
And, looking, sees it not.
She will never watch again!
Never watch and weep at night?
For those pretty, saintly eyes
Look beyond the stormy skies,
And they see the Beacon Light.

 

AFTER THE RAIN.

HE rain has ceased, and in my room
The sunshine pours an airy flood ;
And on the church's dizzy vane

The ancient cross is bathed in blood.

From out the dripping ivy leaves,
Antiquely carven, gray and high,

A dormer‚ facing westward, looks
Upon the village like an eye:

And now it glimmers in the sun,

A globe of gold, a disk, a speck 3
And in the belfry sits a dove

With purple ripples on her neck.
