And fast his blood was flowing ;
And he was sore in pain,

And heavy with his armor,
And spent With changing blows;

And oft they thought him sinking,
But still again he rose.

Never, I ween, did swimmer,
In such an evil case,

Struggle through such a raging flood
Safe to the landing-place.

But his limhs were borne up bravely
By the brave beart within,

And our good Father Tiber
Bare hravel y up his chin.

“ Curse on hin11’' quoth false Sextus3
“ Will not the villain drown‘?

But for this stay, ere close of day
We should have sacked the town! '’

“ Heaven help him 1 '³ quoth Lars Porsena,
“ And bring him safe to shore;

LORD MACAULAY.

For such a gallant feat of arms
Was never seen before.'’

And now he feels the bottom3
Now on dry earth he stands3

Now round him throng the Fathers
To press his gory hands:

And now with shouts and clapping,
And noise of weeping loud,

He enters through the River Gate,
Borne by the joyous crowd.

They gave him of the corn—land
That was of public right
As much as two strong oxen
Could plough from morn till night3
And they made a molten image,
And set it up on high,
And there it stands unto this day
To witness if I lie.

THE: PURITANS OF THE SIXTEENTH OENTURY.

Lord Macauley's glowing description of the Puritians has been pronouneed the finest
writing of its kind to be found in our language. It is the product of pre-eminent literary

ahility‚ and the highest genius.

E would first speak of the Puritans of
v v the sixteenth century, the most re-
markable body of men, perhaps,

which the world has ever produced.

Those who roused the people to resistance
——who directed their measures through a long
series of eventful years-—who formed, out of
the most unpromising materials‚ the finest army
that Europe had ever seen——who trampled
down king, church and aristocracy—-who‚ in
the short intervals of domestic sedition and
rebellion, made the name of England terrible
to every nation 011 the face of the earth—
were no vulgar fanatics.

Most of their absurdities were mere exter-
nal badges, like the signs of freemasonry or
the dresses of friars. We regret that these
badges were not more attractive; we regret
that a body, to whose courage and talents
mankind has owed inestimable obligations,
had not the lofty elegance which distinguished

 

easy good breeding for which the court of
Charles II. was celebrated. But, if we must
make our choice, we shall, like Bassanio in
the play, turn from the specious caskets which
contain only the Death's head and the F ool’s
head, and fix our choice 011 the plain leaden
chest which conceals the treasure.

The Puritans were men whose minds had
derived a peculiar character from the daily
contemplation of superior beings and eternal
interests. Not content with acknowledging,
in general terms, an overruling Providence,
they hahitually ascribed every event to the
will of the Great Being, for whose power
nothing was too minute. To know him, to
serve him, to enjoy him, was with them the
great end of existence.

They rejected with contempt the ceremon-
ious homage which other sects substituted for
the pure worship of the soul. Instead of
catching occasional glimpses of the Deity
