JOHN HOWARD PAYNE.

Say, would you seek instruction ἶ would ye

ask

What ye should do? Ask ye yon conseious
walls

Which saw his poisoned brother—

Ask yon deserted street, where Tullia drove

O'er her dead father’s eorse, ’t will cry,
revenge!

Ask yonder senate-house, whose stones are

ur )le

With hpumlan blood, and it will ery, revenge!

Go to the tomb where lies his murdered wife,

And the poor queen, who loved him as her son,

Their uuappeased ghosts will shriek revenge 1

The temples of the gods, the all-viewing
heavens.

The gods themselves, shall justify the ery,

5219

And we will be revenged, my country—
men !
Brutus shall lead you on ; Brutus, a name
thich will, when you’re revenged, be demur
to him
Thau all the noblcst titles earth ean hoast.
Brutus your king l—No, fellow-eitizens!
If mad ambition in this guilty frame
Had strung one kingly fihre, yea, but one——
By all the gods, this dagget· which I hold
Should rip it out, though it intwined my
heart.
Now take the body up. Bear it before us
To T arquin’s pnlace ; thore we’ll light our
torches,
And in the blazing conflagration rear
A pile, for these chaste relies, that shall send

And swell the general sound, revenge! Her soul amongst the stars. On! Brutus

revenge ἔ

leads you 1

HOME, SWEET HOME.

’ ID pleasures and pal-aces though we may 1

roam,

Be it ever so humble there‘s no place

like home 1

A eharm from the skies seems to hallow us

there,

Which, seek through the world, is ne’er met

with elsewhere.

Home! home! sweet‚ sweet horne!
There's no place like home 1

An exile from home, splendor ‹lazzles in vain !
Oh, give ine my lowlythatched cottuge again!
The birds singing gayly that cume at my ealh—
Give me them, and the peace of mind dearer
than all!
Home! home, etc.
