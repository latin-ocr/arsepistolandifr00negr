ΒΥ PERMISsmN 01⁴⁸ THE AUTHOR.

ROSA BONHEUR has achievcd world· place to abundance; and soon her executive

wide fame and pecuniary independence

as one of the most skilful painters of
animals; the boldness aud independence of
her own character inspiring her pencil, and
her faithfulness to nature giving great force to
her work. The whole civilized world does
homage to her genius 3 and, during the siege
of Paris in the Franco-Prussian war, the
Crown Prince of Prussia gave orders that her
studio and residence at F ontaineblcau should
be spared and respected.

Florence Nightingale, well born, highly
educated, and brilliantly accomplished, gave
herself to the study of hospitals, and of
institutions for the diseased, helpless, and
infirm. Appreciating the work of the Sisters
of Charity in the Catholic church,she felt the
need of an institution which should be its
counterpart in the Protestant Colnmunion.
She visited civil and military hospitals all
over Europe, studied with the Sisters of
Charity in Paris their system of nursing and
hospital management, and went into training
as a nurse in the House of the Protestant
Deaconesses at Kaiserwerth on the Rhine.

For ten years she served an apprenticeship,
preparing for the great work of her life. Her
opportunity came during the war in the
Crimen, when through incompetence, and
utter disregard of sanitary laws, the rate of
mortality in the English hospitals surpasscd
that of the fiercest battles. Horror and
indignation were felt throughout England.
Miss Nightingale offered her services to the
government with a corps of trained nurseS‚
was accepted, and went to Constantinople.

The disorder‚ the want—while storehouses
were bursting with the needed hospital sup-
plies—the incompetence, the uncleanliness,
the suffering and death created general dis-
may. Unappalled by the shocking chaos,
Miss Nightingale ordered the storehouses at
Scutari to be broken open, when want gave

skill and rare knowledge transformed the hos-
pitals into models of order and comfort. She
spared herself no labor, sometimes standing
twenty hours in succession giving directions,
and refusing te leave her post, even when she
broke down with hospital-sever.

Sadly over-worked, her patience and cheer-
fulness were unfailing, winning the love of
the roughest soldicrs; and, as she walked the
wards, men too weak to speak plucked her
gown with feeble fingers, or kissed her shadow
as it fell athwart their pillow. She expended
her own vitality in this work, and returned to
England an invalid for life. But not an idle
invalid, for froin her sick-room there have
gone plans for the improvement of hospitals

and the training of nurscs wrought out by her
busy brain and pen.

Caroline Ilei-schel. sister of the great astro-
nomer, was his constant helper and faithful
assistant, in this character receiving a salary
from the king. In addition she found time
to make her own independent observations,
discovering comets, remarkable nebulae, and
clusters of stars, and receiving from the Royal
Society a gold medal in recognition of her
work.

Chai-lette Bronte’s portion in life was pain
and toil and sorrow. Her experience was a
long struggle with every unkindness of fate, and
she lacked every advantage supposed neces-
sary to literary work. Her force of character
and undismayed persistence triumphed over
all hindranceS. She put heart and conscience
into books that held the literary world iu
fascination. In them she rent the shams of
society by her keen analyses. She depicted
life as she had known it, shorn of every
illusion, and then beautified it by unflinching
loyalty to duty, and unwavering fidelity to
conscience. The publication of “Jane Eyre''
marked an era in the literary world not soon
to be forgotten.
