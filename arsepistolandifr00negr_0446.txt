CHARLES FoLLEN ADAMS.

Famous for Humorous Dialect.

 

-L ’ἶ R. ADAMS must be credited with having entered a new and
v ³ untried field of authorship‚ and with having appropriated it
Ι pretty much to himself. While engaged in business pursusts,
⁴ ⁵ without any intention of becoming an author in the strict
meaning of the term, he began to portray the humorous phases
of the German—American character. His productions at once
became popular. His skill in the use of English, modified by German
accent, is apparent in “ Yawcob Strau55‚'' “Hans and Fritz,'' “ Ah-
Goo,‘' “ The Puzzled Dutchman,'' etc.‚ and is well nigh inimitable.

ΜΓ. Adams is a native of the old Bay State, and was born in Dor-
chester April 21, 1842. He received a common school education, and at
the age of fifteen entered a business house in Boston, where he remained
until August, 1862. The Civil War was then in progress, and his
patriotic spirit led him to enlist in a Massachusetts regiment of volun-
teers. His regiment proved its gallanty in a number of bloody battles
and rendered conspicuous service. .

He was wounded at Gettysburg in 1863, held a prisoner for two days,
and was recaptured by the Federal Army when General Lee abandoned
the field. The war being ended, he returned to Boston and established a
successful business. His dialetic poems are what may be called “ a side
issue.'' They were written as the occasion presented itself and the mood
along with it. It was not until 1872, two years after Mr. Adams had
published his first poem, that “ The Puzzled Dutchman '' appeared. This ,
was followed at intervals by other poenis in dialect, which were contributed
to one or two magazines, until in 1876 he became a regular contributor to
the “ Detroit Free Press‚” and did much to give fame to that humorous
j ourn al.

ΜΓ. Adams' pieces have been widely appropriated for readings and
recitations, their humor, when well interpreted, rendering them extremely

popular. As a man he is quite as genial and agreeable as one would

imagine him to be from his writings.
