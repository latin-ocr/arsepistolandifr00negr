WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.

When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care

Plod on, and each one, as before, will chase

His favorite phantom ; yet all these shall leave

Their mirth and their employments, and shall
come

And make their bed with thee. As the long
train

Of ages glide away, the sons of men—

The youth 111 life's green spring, and he who
goes

Ι 11 the full strength of years, matron and maid,

The bowed with age, the infant in the smiles

And* beauty of its innocent age cut off—

 

37

Shall one by one, be gathered to thy side
By those who in their turn shall follow them·

80 live, that when thy snmmons comes to join

The innuinerable caravan that moves

To the pale realms of shade, where each take

His chaniber in the silent 113115 of death,

T hou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,

Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and
soothed

By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave

Like one who wraps the drapery of his 0011011

About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.

 

SONG OF THE GREEK AMAZON.

BUCKLE to my slender side

The pistol and the scimitar,
And in my maiden flower and pride

Am come to share the tasks of war.
And yonder stands my fiery steed,

That paws the ground and neighs to go,
My charger of the Arab breed—

Ι took him from the routed foe.

My mirror is the mountain spring,
At which Ι dress my ruffled hair;
My dimmed and dusty arms I bring,
And wash away the blood-stain there.
Why should I guard from wind and sun
This cheek, whose virgin rose is fied?
11, was for one—oh, only one—

I keep its bloom, and he is dead.

But they who slew him—unaware
Of coward murderers lurking nigh—
And left him to the fowls of air,
Are yet alive—and they must die.
They slew him and my virgin years
Are vowed to Greece and vengeance now,
And many 311 Othman dame, in tears,
811311 rue the Grecian maiden’s vow.

I touched the lute in the better days,
I led in dance the joyons band ;
Ah! they may move to mirthful lays
Whose hands can touch a lover‘s hand.
The march of hosts that haste to meet
Seems gayer than the dance to me 3
The lute’s sweet tones are not so sweet
As the 111-106 shout of victory.

 

THE BATTLEFIELD.

An English critic, referring to the stanza beginning—‘⁸ T ruth crushed to earth shall rise
again‚'’—said: “Mr. Bryant has certainly a rare merit for having written a stanza which
will bear comparison with any four lines as one of the noblest 111 the English language.
The thought is complete, the expression perfect. A poem of 3 (1οΖ611 such verses would
be like a row of pearls, each beyond a king's ransom.”

NCE this soft turf, this rivulet’s sands,
VVere tramplcd by a hurrying crowd,

And fiery hearts and armed hands
Encountered in the battle-cloud.

Ah! never shall the land forget
How gushed the life-blood of her braye,—
Gushed, warm with hope and courage yet,
Upon the soil they fought to save-

Now all is calm, and fresh, and still,
Alone the ehirp of flitting bird,

And talk of children on the hill,
And bell of wandering kine, are heard.

No solemn host goes trailing by

The black-mouthed gun and staggering wain3

Men start not at the battle-cry:

Oh, be it never heard again!
