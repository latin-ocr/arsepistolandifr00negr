276 DANIEL WEBSTER.

speech, even to those who take little interest in subjects like the tariff,
nullification, and the public landS, will ever be interesting, from its pro-
found knowledge, its clear arrangement, the broad stamp of nationality it
bears, and the wit, sarcasm, and splendid, impassioned eloquence, which
add brilliance to its wisdom and clearness to “the close and rapid march

of its argument.''

‘⁴ Our impression is‚' said an able English writer, “that excepting
for Mirabeau, Chatham, Fox, and Brougham, no speaker entirely the
match of Daniel Webster has trod the world-stage for full two centuries.'’

Among his own countrymen, too, he has received the highest praise.
His speeches take the highest rank among the best productions of the
American intellect. They are thoroughly national in their spirit and
tone, and are full of principles, arguments, and appeals, which come
directly home to the hearts and understanding of the great body of the
people. They are storehouses of thought and knowledge, solid judgment,
high sentiment, and broad and generous views of national policy.

When the great statesman was seventy years old, his birthday was
celebrated in Boston by a grand ovation. In the speech he made thank-
ing his friends for the honor they paid him, he told the secret of his
success in the words, “ Work has made me what Ι am. 1 never ate a bit
of idle bread in my life.’'

Daniel XVebster was born at Salisbury, New Hampshste, January 18,
1782. He died at Marshfield‚ Massachusetts, October 24, 1852.
