322 FISHER AMES.

After a service of eight years in Congress, on the retirement of
Washington he also quitted public life. He resided on his farm in
Dedham, occasionally appearing in the courts, and devoting his leisure
to eorrespondence, and the composition of politica] essays, which, though
published anonymously, had a powerful influence upon public opinion.
In 1804 he was elected President of Harvard College, but on account of
ill health declined the office. His debility continued gradually to increase
until the fourth of July‚ 1808, when he died.

THE INFAMY OF VIOLATIN‘G TREATIES.

break our faith. To expatiate on the
value of public saith may pass with

some men for declamation z to such nien Ι

What. is patriotism? Is it a narrow affec-
tion for a spot where a man was born? Are
the very clods where we tread entitled to this
ardent preference, because they are greener‘?
No, sir; this is not the character of the virtue.
It soars higher for its object. It is an ex-
tended sels—love, mingling with all the enjoy-
ments of life, and twisting itself with the
minutest filaments of the heart. It is thus we
obey the laws of society, because they are the
laws of virtue. In their authority we see, not
the array of force and terrm-‚but the venerable
image of our country’s honor. Every good
citizen makes that honor his own, and cherishes
it, not only ns procious, but as sacred. He is
willing to risk his life in its defence, and is

 

conscious that he gains protection while he
gives it.

What rights of a citizen will be deemed in·
violable‚ when a State renounces the principles
that constitute their security? Or, if his life
should not be invaded, what would its enjoy-
ments be, in a country odious in the eye of

strangers, and dishonored in his own? Could .

he look with affection and veneration to such

a country, as his parent? The sense of having Ἴ

one would die within him; he would blush

for his patriotism, if he retained any,—and ἰ
justly, for it would be a vice. He would be a 1

banished man in his native land.
