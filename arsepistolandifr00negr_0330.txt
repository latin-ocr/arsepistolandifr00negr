THE GRAPE-VINE SWING.

LITHE und long as the serpent truiu,

Springing and clinging from tree 10 4

tree,
Now darting upward, now down again,
With a twisting and a twirl that are strange

' Never took serpent a deadlier hold, [to see ;

Never the cougar a wilder spring,
Strangling the oak with the boa’s sold,
Spanning the beech with the condor's wing.

Yet no foe that we sear to seek—

The boy leaps wild 10 thy rude ernbrace:
Thy bulging arms bear as soft aoheek

As ever on lover’s breast found plaee;

ᾗ On thy waving traiu is a playful hold
T 11011 shalt never to lighter grasp persuade ;
thile a maiden sits in thy drooping fold,
And swings and sings in the noonday shade!

O giant strange of our southern woods‚

I dream of thee still in the well-known spot.
Though 0111· 105501 strains o’er the ocean floods,
And the northern forest behold thee not;

I think of 11100 still with a sweet regret,
As the corda ge yields to my playful grasp—>
Dost thou spring and cling in our woodlands
yet ἶ) [clasp?

 

Does the maiden still swing in thy giant

 

THE LOST PLEIAD.

OT in the sky,
V‘Vhere it was seen, [wave‚
Nor on the white tops of the glistering
Nor in the mansions of the hidden deep,—
Though green,
And beautiful, its caves of mystery—
shall the bright watcher have

A place—and, as of old, high station keep.

Gone, gone!

O, never more to eheer

The mariner who holds his course alone

On the Afflantio, through the weary night,
then the stars turn to 1101011015 and do sleep,
Shall it appear,

With the sweet fixedness of certain light,
Down-shining on the shut eyes of the deep.

Vain, vain!

Hopeful most idly then, shall he look forth,
That mariner from his bark—
Howe'er the north [lower—
Doth raise 1115 certain lamp when tempests
He sees 110 more that perished light again 1
Α11(1 gloomier grows the hour [ing dark,
Which may not, through the thick and grop-

Restore that lost and loved one 10 her tower.

He looks—the Shepherd 011 ΟΙ]01(100’5 111115,
Teuding his 110οΚ5-

And wondezs the rich beacon doth not blaze,
Gladdening his gaze;

And, from his dreary watoh along the rocks,
Guiding him safely home th rough perilous ways!
How stands he in amaze,

81111 wondering, as 1110 drowsy silence fills
The sorrowful scene, and every hour distils
Its lenden dews—how ohafes he at the night,

81111 510117 10 bring the expected and sweet light,
80 natural 10 1115 sight!

And lone,

there its 11151 splendors 5110110,

811011 110 that pleasant company of stars:
How should they know that death

Such perfect heauty mars3 [breath‚
And, like 1110 earth, 115 common bloom and
Fallen from on high,

Their li ghts grow blasted byits 1011011, and die—
All their concerted springs of harmony,
Snapped rudely, and the generous 11111510 gone.

A stram—a mellow—

Of wailing 511700111055, 1111οᾶ 1110 earth and sky3
The stars lamenting in unborrowed pain
That one of the selectest ones must die;

Must vanish, when most lover, from the rest!
Alasl 'tis ever more the destiny,

The hope, beart-cherished, is the soonest lost 3
The flower first budded soonest feels the frost:
Are not the shortest-lived still loveliest?
And, like the pole star shooting down the sky,
Look they not ever brightest when they fly
The desolate home they blessed?
