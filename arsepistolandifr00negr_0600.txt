Celebratcd Historiam and Essayist.

 

HOMAS RABINGTON MACAULAY, the distinguished his-⁷

torian and one of the greatest of English writers, was born in
1 Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, in 1800. At Trinity College ⁴
⁴ his career was not the success anticipatod, owing to his weak-
ness in mathematics. ln 1824 he was elected a Fellow of the
college, and in 1826 called to the bar. He devoted much time

to both politics and literature, and it was during this period that many

of his famous essays appeared.
111 1832 he was appointed a member of the newly·formed supreme ,

Indian conncil and drew the draft of what in time became the penal code
of India. In 1839 having returned to England, he became secretary of
war. Shortly afterwards he began work on his “ History of England,’'
the first two volumes of which appeared in December, 1848„ The third
and fourth volumes were publishcd in 1855, and in 1857 he was rewarded
with a peerage. He succeeded in bringing his history down to the death .
of william 111„ and died himself December 28, 1859, and was honored
with a resting place in that renowned mausoleum of monarchs, heroes,
poets and statesmen, W'estminster Abbey. His fame rests chiefly on this
history and on his essays, although some of his poems have gained a
wide celebrity.

In our American schools and uuiversities the writings of Macaulay
have long been considered as models of literary composition. The lang-
uage is chaste and well chosen, the style is exceedingly polished and
ornate, the elevation of thought and sentiment is constantly apparent,
and although we discover constantly the marks of the hammer’s finishing

 

strokes, his writings are not lacking in that rugged force which arouses Α

and masters the reader.
Macaulay never married. His devotion to the members of his imme-

diate family who needed his strong arm for strength and support, was

one of his distinguishing traits and endeared him to the public3 so much

so, that a certain feeling of affection may be said to have mingled with
