“ Who was Μ155 Meadows, Uncle Remus?''

he found 1116 01(1 man iu great glee. Indeed, inquired the little boy.

Uncle Remus was talking and laughing to
himself at such 11 rate that the little boy was
afraid hehad company. The truth is, Unele
Remus had heard the child coming, and when
the rosy-eheeked chap put his head in at the
door, was engaged 111 6 monologue‚ the burden
of which seemed to be—

Settin' in de cornder
Smokin' yo’ seegyar?''

reminded the little boy of the fact that the
wieked Fox was still in pursuit of the Rabbit,
aud he immediately put 1115 curiosity in the
shape of 6 question.
