WILLIAM COWPER.

Thy nightly visits to my chamber made,

1 Τ1131 111011 mightst know me safe and warmly

Thy mdssiiirig bounties ere I lest my home,
The bisc-uit or confectionery plum :

The fragrant waters on my cheeks bestowed
By thine own haud, till fresh they shone and
All thiglgzvgdfflore endearing still than all,

Say, wast thou conscious of the tears Ι shed? Thy constant flow of love, that knew no fall—

Hovered thy spirit o‘er thy sorrowing son,—

lVretch even then, life's journey just begun?

Perhaps thou gavest 1110, though unfelt, a
kiss;

Perhaps a tear, if souls can weep in bliss—

Ah, that maternal smile! it answers—YeS.

I heard the bell tolled on thy 11111131 day;

I fflw the hearse that bore thee slow away ;

And, turning from my nursery windmv, drew

A long, long sigh, and wept a last adieu!

But was it such ?—1t was—Where thou art
gone

Adieus and farewells are a sound unknown ;

May I but meet thee on that peaceful shore,

Ne'er roughened by those cataracts and breaks

That humor, interposed, too often makoe;

All this, still legible in memory’s page,

And still to be so to my latest age,

Adds joy to duty, makes 1110 glad to pay

Such honors to thee as my numbers may—

Perhaps a frail memorial, but sincere—

Not scorned in heaven, though little noticed
here.

Could time, his flight reversed, restore the
When,Zgllarysring with thy voeture's tissued
owers—

The parting word shall pass my lips no more. 1 The violet, the pink, the jessamine‚—
Thy maidens, grieved themselves at my con· 1 Ι pricked thern into paper with a pin,

cern,
Oft gave me promise of thy quick return ;
that ardently I wished I long believed,
And, disappoiuted still, was still deceived,—
By expectation every day beguiled,
Dupe of to-morrow even from a child.
Thus many a sad to morrow came and went,
Till, all my stock of infant sorrows spent,
I learned at last submission to my lot;

thou wast happier than myself the
while—

1 1Ῡο111ᾱ31 softly speak, and stroke my head and

smile.)—

³ Could those few pleasant days again appear,

Might one wish bring them, would I wish
them here?

¹ Ι would not trust my beart,—the dear delight

Seems so to be desired, perhaps I might.

But, though I less deplored thee, ne’er forgot. But no,—what here 110 0311 our life 13 such,

So little to be loved, and thou so much,
