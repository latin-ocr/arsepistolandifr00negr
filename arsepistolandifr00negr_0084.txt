60 EDGAR ALLAN POE.

engaged by him to be its editor. He continued in this situation about a
year and a half, in which he wrote many brilliant articleS‚ and raised the
“ Messenger '‘ to the first rank of literary periodieals.

He next removed to Philadelphia, to assist Mr. W. E. Burton in the
editorship of the “ Gentleman's Magazine,’' a miscellany that in 1840 was
merged in “ Graham's Magazine,'' of which Mr. Poe became one of the
principa] writers, particularly in criticism, in which his papers attracted
much attention, by their careful and skilful analysiS, and generally
caustic severity. At this period, however, he appears to have been more
ambitious of securing distinction in romantic fiction, and a collection of
his compositions in this department, published in 1841, under the title
of ‘⁴ Tales of the Grotesque and the Arabesque,'' established his reputation
for ingenuity, imagination and extraordinary power in tragical narration.

Near the end of 1844, Mr. Poe removed to New York, where he con-
ducted for several months a literary miscellany called “The Broadway
Journal.'' In 184 5 he published a volume of T ales, in Wiley and Putnam's
“ Library of American Books‚'' and in the same series, a collection of his
Poenis, including “The Raven,'' of which Mr. N. Ρ. Willis observes, that
in his opinion “ it is the most effective single example of fugitive poetry
ever published in this country, and is unsurpassed in English poetry for
subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of versification‚ and consistent
sustaining of imaginative lift.‘'

“ Ulalun1e‚’' “ Annabel Lee,’' and “To ,'‘ were written after the
appearance of Mr. Poe's volume. In poetry, as in prose, he is most suc-
cessful in the metaphysica] treatment of the passionS. His poems are con-
structed with consummate art. They illustrate a morbid sensitiveness of
feeling, a shadowy and gloomy imagination‚ and a taste almost faultless
in the apprehension of that sort of beauty most agreeable to his temper.

Besides the volumes mentioned, Mr. Poe is the author of “Arthur
Gordon Pym,’' a romance3 ⁴‘ A New Theory of English Versification ;''
“ Eureka‚‘' an essay on the material and spiritual universe ε a work which
he wishes to have “ judged as a poem ;'' and several extended series of
papers in the periodicals, the most noticeable of which were “ Marginalia’'
embracing opinions of books and authors; “ Secret Writing‚’' “ Auto-
graphy,'‘ and “ Sketches of the Literati of New York.''

Among Mr. Poe's stories the most familiar are, “The Gold Bug,“ and

 

“The Mystery of Maril Roget.'' He was also the author of Essays on
MrS. Browning, Macaulay, DickenS, Lever‚ Longfellow and Hawthorne.
