‘⁸‘ *s* HIS popular American novelist, born at Burlington, New Jersey,
’ ¹ in September, 1789, was a son of Judge William Cooper. His
' mother's maiden name was Fenimore. About 1790 his father
settled at Cooperstown‚ which he founded on the shore of Lake
Otsego‚ New York‚ where he owned a large tract of land, then
covered with forests and lying 011 the frontier of civilization.

 

He entered Yale College in 1802, remained there about three yearS,
and became a midshipman in the navy in 1806. Having retired from the
navy in 1811, he married Susan DeLancey‚ of New York, a sister of
Bishop DeLancey. His first literary production was “ Precaution‚’' a
novel, (1819,) which was inferior to his later works. He published next
“ The Spy, a Tale of the Neutral Ground‚'‘ founded on incidents connected
with the Revolutionary war, which was very successful and was published
in many parts of Europe. It was translated into several languages.

(1827) “ The Red Rover,'‘ (1827) “The Wept of Wish-ton-Wish,” (1829) ,1
“ The Bravo‚'’ (18 3 1) and other works. Alluding to his admirable delinea- ,ἵ
tions of life at sea in the “ Pilot '' and the “ Red Rover,'' the “ Edinburgh J
Review '' says, “The empire of the sea has been conceded to him by “a- ¹
acclamation.'' He satirized the foibles of his own countrymen in “The ⁴
Monikins,'' (1835), “ Homeward Bound‚‘' (1838) and “ Home as Found,'’ ,1, 3
