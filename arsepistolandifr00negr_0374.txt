LoulsE CHANDLER MOULTON-.
Poet and Novelist.

 

6 . RS. MOULTON’S reputationis not of the fitful, fictitious variety,
γ but rests on solid merit. Whether she writes her delightful
, ‚ tales for the little people, or addresses herself to adults of cul-
- ³ “' ture and critical taste, she meets every requirement and easily
wius the love and admiration of her readers.

 

Of engaging personality, pleasing manners, and always
conveying the impression of that refinement which belongs to the true
lady, she is one of the centra] attractions of every literary circle of which
she forms a part. Her writings include poems, essays, newspaper corres-

aim is always high and she never writes when she has nothing to say.

Mrs. Moulton's maiden name was Louise Chandler. Her birthplace
was Pomfret, Conn., and the date of her birth is April 5, 1835. She
received the ordinary education given to a New England country girl.
From a very early age she showed her literary tendencies, and when only
nineteen years old published a volume of poems entitled, “This, That
and the Other,’' which was well received and was really the beginning of
her career as an author. Having spent a year after this at Miss Willard's
Seminary in Troy, she married a well-known Boston journalist, William

Her next effort as author was in the line of fiction, which was pub-
lished anonymously under the title of “ Juno Clifford.'' In 1859 appeared
another volume from her pen, entitled “My Third Book.’' Up to this
time her writings of fiction had not been remarkably successful, although
exhibiting evidences of that superior talent which was afterward
apparent in all her works.

In 1855 Mrs. Moulton took up her residence in Boston, but subse-
quently passed sixteen consecutive summers and autumus in Europe. In
London she was widely and favorably known among authors and people
of artistic and literary tastes. Her greatest success was with her “ Bed-

time Stories for Children,'’ which was published in 1873. She has a
