Sm WALTER SooTT.
N ovelist and Poet.

. IR WALTER SCOTT, baronet, the eldest son of Walter Scott,
. ⁸ was born in the city of Edinburgh, Scotland, August 15, 1771.
⁹ ' ν’ κ It is proper to remark that his mother was a lady of talent‚ the
'⁴⁵ friend of Burns and Ramsay, and the author of some merito-

great originality and beauty, were produced in 1805 and 1808, and
received at once into favor.

friend started in to ‘heeze up my hope,' like the minstrel in the old song.
He was bred a farmer, but aman of powerful understanding, natural
good taste, and warni poetical feeling, perfectly competent to supply the

wants of an imperfect or irregular education. He was a passionate
admirer of field sports, which we often pursued together.
