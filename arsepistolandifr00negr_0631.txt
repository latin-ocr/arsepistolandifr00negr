ALGERNON CHARLES SwlNssnRNE.

Poet of Passion.

HIS famous English poet, whose genius is both brilliant and
audacious, was born in London, April 5, 1837. The
son of Admiral Swinburne and Lady Henrietta Ashburn-
ham, he was given every possible advantage in youth, being
educated in France and later at Eton and at Oxford. He left
the university‚ however, without taking a degree. His tastes

were literary and artistic, and these, together with his associations‚

induced him to make literature his vocation. He soon acquired a reputa-
tion for the facility of his versification and for the thinly veiled love
passion of his verse.

He first attracted attention in 1861, when he published “The Queen
Mother '' and “ Rosan1ond.'’ These first successes were followed in 1864
by “Atalanta in Calydon 3 ” “ Chastelard, a Tragedy‚'' 1365 3 and “ Poenis
and Ballads‚'' 1866. These last poems were severely censured‚ and Swin-
burne withdrew the edition. He, however, reprinted the book the same
year as “Laus Veneris and Other Poems and Ballads.'' Since then
Swinburne has published volumes of prose or verse almost yearly, at
times issuing two or three books in a year. His prose for the most part

is in the form of literary studies. He has also written several strong
tragedieS.
