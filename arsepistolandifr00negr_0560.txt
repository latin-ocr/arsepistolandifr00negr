“If you're Mastor Murdstone‚'’ 311111 the
13 lv, “why do youg 00 311 l give another name

I explained to the lady how it 11113, 11110

6111116 running out of a kite hen on the opposite

31 16 of the yard to show it, and seemed a good
1161311 surprised when he found he was only to
show it to me.

It was a large long room with some large
maps in it. I doubt if Ι 6011111 have felt much
sti-anger if the maps had been real foreign
corinti-ies, and Ι cast away in the middle of
them. Ι f‹=lt it was taking a liberty to sit
down, with my cap in my hand, on the corner
of the 611311· nearest the door; and when the
waiter laid a eloth 011 purpose for me, and put
a set of castcrs on it, Ι think I must have
turned red all over with modesty.

He brought me some chops and vegetables,
and took the 611613 off in such a bouncing
manner that Ι 1133 afraid Ι must have given
him some offence. But he greatly relieved my
mind by putting a ehair for me at the table,
and saying very affably,
come on! ’'

Ι thanked him; and took my seat at the
board; but found it extremely difficult to
handle my knife and fork with anything like
dexterity‚ or to avoid splashing myself with
thc gravy, while he was standing opposite,
staring so hard, and making me blush in the
most dreadful manner every time I caught his

eye. After watehing 1116 into the second chop,
116 said :

“ Now, six-foot !

“ There’s half a pint of ale for you. Will
you have it now? '’

I thanked him, and said “ Yes.’' Upon
which 116 poured it out of a jug into a large
tumbler‚ and held it up against the light, and
11111116 it look beautiful.

“My eye! '’ he said.

“It does seem a good deal,’' Ι 3331161611,
with a smile. For it was quite delightful to
1116 to find him so pleasant. He was atwink-
ling- e-y ed, pimple- -faced man, with his hair

“There was a gentleman here yesterday,’-

Topsawyer—perhaps you know him ⁴? ''

Ι was very much shocked to hear of tn·

“ Why, you 366,” 33111 the waiter, still look'

of his eyes shut up, “our people don’t lik-

“What have we got here?’' he said, put-52

“Chops‚'' I said.
