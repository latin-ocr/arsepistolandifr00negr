FAVORITE POEMS AND PROSE SELECTIONS.

Ι want a garden and a park,
My dwelling to surround—

A thousand acres (bless the mark 1)
With walls encompassed round—-

NVhere flocks may range and herds may low,

And kids and lambkins play,
And flowers and fruits commingled grow,
All Eden to display.

I want when summer’s foliage falls,
And autumn strips the trees,

A house within the city’s walls,
For comfort and for ease ;

But here as space is somewhat scant,
And acres somewhat rare,

My house in town I only want
To occupy—a square.

I want a cabinet profuse
Of metals, coins, and gems;
A printing press for private use,
- Of fifty thousand ems;
And plants, and minerals, and shells;
Worms, insects, fishes‚ birds;
And every beast on earth that dwelt
In solitude or herds.

And maples of fair glossy stain,
Must form my chamber doors,

And carpets of the Wilton grain
Must cover all my floors;

My walls with tapestry bedecked‚
Must never be outdone ;

And damask curtains must protect
Their colors from the sun.

And mirrors of the largest pane
From Venice must be brought;
And sandal-wood and bamboo-cane
For chairs and tables bought ;

On all the mantel-picces‚ clocks
Of thrice-gilt bronze must stand,
And screens of ebony and box
Invite the stranger’s hand.

I want (who does not want ‘?) a wife,
Affectionate and fair,

To solace all the woes of life,
And all its joys to share ;

27

Of temper sweet, of yielding will,
Of firm yet placid mind,

With all my faults to love me still,
With sentiment refined.

And when my bosom's darling sings,
With melody divine,
A pedal harp of many strings
Must with her voice combine.
Piano, exquisitely wrought,
Must open stand, apart,
T hat all my daughters may be taught
To win the stranger’s heart.

My wife and daughters will desire
Refreshment from persumes,

Cosmetics for the skin require,
And artificial blooms.

The civet fragrance shall dispense‚
And treasured sweets return ;
Cologne revive the flagging sense,

And smoking amber burn.

I want a warm and faithful friend,
To cheer the adverse hour,

tho ne'er to flattery will descend,
Nor bend the knee to power:

A friend to chide me when I'm wrong,
My inmost soul to see ;

And that my friendship prove as strong
For him, as his for me.

Ι want a kind and tender heart,
For others' wants to feel:

A soul secure from fortune's dart,
And bosom armed with steel;
To bear Divine chastisement’s rod,
And, iningling in 1ny plan,
Submission to the will of God,

With charity to man.

I want uninterrupted health‚
Throughout my long career,

And streams of never-failing wealth‚
To scatter far and near—-

The destitute to clothe and seed,
Free bounty to bestow,

Supply the helpless orphan's need,
And soothe the widow’s woe.
