GEoRoE Eum. ,
Distinguished Novelist. i

- HIS celebrated author's maiden name was Mary Ann EvanS.
She was the daughter of Robert Evans, a surveyor, and was
born at Griff, near Nuneaton‚ November 22, 1819. Her mind
was easily engrossed and entertained with metaphysical sub-
jects even when she was quite young, and this mental charac- l
teristic can be discerned in greater or less degree in nearly all
her writingS. As she grew to womanhood her intellectual power asserted ·
stself, and she essayed to cope with subjects the most abstruse and difficult
of understanding. ,

In 1846 she translated Strauss' “ Life of Jesus,'' which was followed
in 1853 by Fenerbach’s “ Essence of Christianity.'' One would hardly

 

 

 

 

have predicted that a lady with such scholarly attainments would turn
her thoughts toward the lighter department of literature which comes
under the name of fiction. She did, however, publish in “Blackwood’s
Magazine'' a series of stories entitled “Scenes of Clerical Life,'‘ ini
which she first took the masculine name of George Eliot.

In 18 58 she gained a wide and enviable reputation by her “Adam ·
Bede,'' a story of north country English life that brought her into imme-
diate prominence. This was followed by “The Mill on the Floss,'’
‘'Silas Marner‚'' “Romola‚‘' “Felix Holt‚'' “Middlemarch,'’ “Daniel

Dero11da,‘’ and other works‚ all of which sustained her reputation‚ and
had a large circulation. Their originality, profound thought and masterly
diction are universally admitted.

Her unconventional alliance with Mr. Lewes, an author and writer of
some repute‚ led to a good deal of comment, but can be accounted for from
the fact that her views and opinions were always of the advanced kind,-
and she had little veneration for the customs and usages of society, con-

sidering that to a large degree she was privileged to be a law unto her-
self. After the death of Mr. Lewes she was married to a Mr. Cross

in the spring of 1880, and died at Chelsea, December 22, of the sames

year5.86 She holds first place among analytical novelists.
