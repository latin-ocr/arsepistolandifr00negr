4:38 FAVORI'PE POEMS AND PROSE SELECTIONS.

His neighhors he did not ahuse— His worldly goods he never threw
Was sociahle and gay : In trust to fortune’s chauces,

Hc wore large buckles 011 his shoes, But lived (as all his brothers do)
And changed them every day. In easy circumstances.

His knowledge, hid from public gaze, Thus undisturbed by anxious cares,
lle did not bring to view, His peaceful moments ran;

Nm- nmke a noise, town-meeting days, Anzl everybody said he was
As many people do. A fine old gentleman.

THE DYING HEBREW.
BY KIMBIE.

The fidlmving poeni, a favorite with the celebrated actor, the late Mr. Edwin Forrest, was
composed hy a yonnj„r law student, and first published in Boston in 1858.

HEBREW knelt in the dying light, And always when I felt Thee near,
llis eye was dim and eold ; My Shoes were off my feet,
The hairs on his hrow were silver white, Ι have known-Thee in the Whjrlwind‚
And his blood was thin and old! Ι have known Thee on the hill
He liftcd his look to his latest sun, Ι have loved Thee in the voice of' birds,

For he knew that his pilgrimage was done;
And as he saw God’s shadow there,
His spirit poured itself in prayer!

Or the music of the rill;
Ι dreamt Thee in the shadow‚
Ι saw Thee in the light3

‘⁶ I come unto Death's second birth I blessed Thee in the radiant day,
Beneath a stranger air, And worshipped Thee at night.
A pilgrim on a dull, cold earth, An beauty, while it spoke of Thee,

As all iny fathers were 1 Stin made my goul rejoice'

And nien have stamped me with a curse
I feel it is not Thine3

Thy mercy, like yon sun, was made
On me, as them, to shine3

And my spirit bowed within itself
To hear Thy still, small voice!

“ Ι have not felt myself a thing,

“ And therefore dare I lil't mine eye Far from Thy presence driven,
Thongh that to Thee before I die! By flamissg SWOl‘d 01· waving wing

The Hebrew met his God, But Ι will not take my curse from man·—
I turn to Thee alone!
“ Ι have not caused the widow's tears, Oh, bid my fainting spirit live,
Nor dimmed the orphan's eye ; And what is dark reveal‚
Ι have not stained the virgin’s years, And what is evil, oh, forgive,
Nor mocked the lnonrner's cry. And what is broken heal.
The songs of Zion in mine ear And cleanse my nature from above,

Have ever been most sweet, In the dark Jordan of Thy lovel
