RffiHARD HENRY STODDARD.

Journalist and Poet.

 

Ξῖ · R. STODDARD was born at Hingham, Mass, and in child-
* hood removed to New York City.

ἶ s The first poem to which his name was attached attracted
- ’⁹ ‘⁴' notice by a purity and quiet grace of language, which, though
echoing at times the masters of song whom he studied, would
have suggested a greater range of opportunity and experience
than he actually possessed. ln the autumn of 1848 he collected a number
of his effusions, most of which had previously been published in the
Knickerbocker and Union Magazine, into a small volume, with the title
of “Foot-Prints.''

This volume was well received3 notwithstanding some traces of
unconscious imitation, natural to a young writer, it gave evidence of a
clear and vigorous fancy and a correct appreciation of the harmonies of
sound and rhythm. Perhaps the most individua] trait displayed in its
pages is a capacity for finished and picturesque description. His land-
⁷ scapes have a sharp and distinct outline, in which none of the minor
features are omitted—a keen perception of form, in striking contrast to
the more glowing colorin g and careless outline of young writers in general.

A second collection of Mr. Stoddard's poems appeared in 1851,
These gave evidence of a growing literary taste and of his more thorough
command of his affluent gifts. In 18 52 he married Elizabeth D. Barstow,
a poetess. She was a help to him in his literary pursuits, being a person
of good judgment and refined taste.

From 1853 to 1870 Mr. Stoddard held a position in the Custom
Hou'se of New York, and in 1877 was appointed City Librarian. Among
’· his later works are ‘⁴ Life of A. Von Humboldt'' (1860), ‘⁶ The King’s
Bell’' (1862), and “ The Book of the East ’' (1871). A complete edition
of his poems, in one volume, appeared in 1880. He has also edited a
’ number of books, among others “ The Bric-a-Brac Series,'' (1874—75).
