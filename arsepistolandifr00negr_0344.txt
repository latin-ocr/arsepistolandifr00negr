Wltt CARLETON.
Poct of Rura] Life.

'² 1ΨΒ, have in Mr. Carlcton one who is a genius in describing
common things and the scenes of country lise. He never
flics ovcr your head3 he never drags you into the mire of
vulgarity. The homely farmer and his plain wife appear in
their true characters, and neither suffers srom the portraiture
the poet draws with mastcrly skill.

He is easily first among the writers of the day who are describing
country life--the greatest life os the nation—and though he uses little or
no dialect in doing it, such poenis as “ Betsy and Ι are Out‚'' “Little
Golden-hair ” and their companion pieces have touched the hearts of the
American public.

Mr. Carleton was born in Hndson, Lcnawce County, Mich.‚ October
21, 1845. Η6 received the ordinary education of a boy of that region of
apple orchards, of good roads, winding beside lakes, and of good schools.
He graduatcd at Hillsdale College in 1869. After his graduation he
visited Europe and repeated the trip, making an earnest study of general
European life as compared with the American. He began soon after his
return a series of contributions to periodicals and magazines, and one day
found himself suddenly famous by productions published in the east,
“ Over the Hills to the Poorllonse '’ and “ Betsy and 1 are Out,'’ being,
doubtless‚ the most potent in giving him the wide reputation he 50 sud-
denly attained.

He has lectured in Great Britain, Canada and the United States and
has proved an exceedingly popular man before an audience. His pub-
lished books include “ Poems'' (Chicago‚ 1871), “Farm Ballads‘' (New
York, 1873), “ Farm Legends (1875), “ Young Folk's Centennial,''
“Rhyines,'' “ Farm Festivals,’' “ City Ballads '' ancl others. With a keen
perception of what was about him, and the gift of language for express·
ing in words that which he sees and feels‚ Mr. Carleton has won fairly

the position he now occupies in the literarv world. He is one of the
