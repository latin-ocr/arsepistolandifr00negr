EDGAR ALLAN POE. 65

And the silken, sad, uncertain
Rustling of each purple curtain

Thrilled me——filled me with fantastic
Terrors never felt before ;

' So that now, to still the beating

Of my heart, I stood repeating

·‘ ’'sis some visitor entreating
Entranoe at my ehamber door—

Some late visitor entreating
Entranee at my chamber door—
This it is, and nothing more.''

Presently my soul grew stronger;

Hositating then no longer,

“ Sir,” said I, “or Madam‚ truly
Your forgiveness Ι implore;

But the fact is Ι was napping,

And so gently you came rapping,

And so faintly you came tapping,
Tapping nt my ohamber door,

That I scarae was sure Ι heard you”—-
Here I opened wide the door:
Darkness there and nothing morel

Deep into that darkness peering,
Long Ι stood there wondering‚ fearing,
Doubting‚ dreaming dreams no mortal
Ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken‚
’ And the darkness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken
Was the whispered word, “ Lenore ! ''
This I whispered, and an echo
Murmured back the word, “ Lenore,'’
’ Merely this, and nothing more.

Then into the chamber turning,
All my soul within me burning,
Soon I heard again a tapping
Somewhat louder than before.
“ Surely‚'' said I, “ surely that is
Something at my window lattice ;
Let me see, then, what thereat is,
And this mystery explore—
Let my heart be still a moment,
And this mystery explore—
’Tis the wind, and nothing more! ”

Open here I flung the shutter,
When, with many a flirt and flutter,
5

In there steppe‹l a stately raven
Of the saintly days of yore;
Not the least oheisance made he;
Not an instant stopped or stayed he;
But with mien of lord or lady,
Perched above my chamber door-2
Perohed upon a bust of Pallas
Just above my ehamber door—
Perehed, and sat, and nothing more.

Then this ebony bird heguiling

My sad fancy into smiling,

By the grave and stern decorum
Of the countenanoe it wore,

“ Though thy erest be shorn and shaven,

Th‹›u‚'’ I said, “ art sure no craven,
Ghastly grim and ancient raven,
Wandering from the N ightly shore—
Tell me what thy lordly name is
On the Night‘s Plutonian shore! '’
Quoth the raven ‘⁶ Nevermore.’'

Mueh Ι marvelled this nngainly

Fowl to hear discourse so plainly,

T hough its answer little meaning—
Little rolevancy bore ;

For we omnot help agreeing

That no living human being

Ever yet was blessed with seeing
Bird above his chamber door-

Bird or beast upon the sculptured
Bust above his chamber door,
With such name as “ Nevermore.

But the raven sitting lonely
On the placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in
That one word he did outpour.
Nothing further then he uttered—
Not a feather then he fluttered—
Till I scarcely more than muttered
“ Other friends have flown before·-
On the morrow he will leave me,
As my hopes have flown before.’'
Then the bird said “ Nevermore.”

Startled at the stillness broken
By reply so aptly spoken,
“ Doubtless‚'’ said I, “ what it utters
It is only stock and store
