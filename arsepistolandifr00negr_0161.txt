Parson Wilbur sez he never heerd in his life Wal, it's a marey we’ve gut folks to tell us
Thet th’ Apostles rigged out in their swaller- The rights an' the wrongs 0' these matters,

tail coats, Ι vow,——
An' marched round in front of a drum an' a God sends country lawyers, an' other wise
fife, fellers,
To git some on ’em office, an' some on 'em To drive the world's team when it gits in a

Sez they didn't know everythin' down in Sez the world'll go right, ef he hollers out

WITHOUT AND WI'I'HIN.

Y coachman, in the moonlight there, Meanwhile Ι inly curse the bore
Looks through the side-light of the door; Of hunting still the same old coon,
I hear him with his brethren swear, And envy 111111, outside the door,
As Ι 60111(1 do—but only more. In golden quiets of the moon.
Flattening his nose against the pane, The winter wind is not so cold
He envies me my brilliant lot, As the bright smile he sees me win,
Breathes on his aching fists in vain, Nor the host’s oldest wine so old
And dooms me to a place more hot. As our poor gabble sour and 111111.
Η6 8668 1116 111 10 supper go, I envy him the ungyved prance
A silken wonder by my side, By which his freezing feet he warms,
Bare arms, bare shoulders‚ and a row And drag my lady’s chains, and dance
Of fiounces, for the door too wide. The galley-slave of dreary forms.
He thinks how happy is my arm Oh, could he have my share of din,
'Neath its white-gloved and jewelled load ς And I his quiet 1—-past a doubt
And wishes me some dreadful harm, 'Twould still be one man bored within,
Hearing the merry corks explode And just another hored without.

 

THE GOURTIN’.
OD makes sech nights‚ all white an' still The wa'nut logs shot sparkles out

Fur ’z you can look or listen. Towards the pootiest, bless her,v
Moonshine an' snow on field an’ hill, An’ leetle flames danced all about
All silence an' all glisten. The chiny on the dresser.
Zekle crep’ up quite unbeknown Agin the chimbley crook-necks hung,
An' peeked in thru’ the winder, An’ in amongst 'em rusted
An' there sot Huldy all alone, The ole queen's arm thet gran'ther Young
⁵ 'Ith no one nigh to hender. Fetched back from Concord busted.
A fireplace filled the room’s one side The very 100111, coz she was in,
With half a cord o' wood in— Seemed warm from floor to ceilin'‚
There warn't no stoves (tell comfort died) An’ she looked full ez rosy agin

To bake ye to a puddin'. ’ Ez the apples she was peelin’.
