JAMES KIRKE PAULDING.

which he laid out into thirteen good farms;
and building himself a fine frame house, about
half-finished, began to be quite snug and com-

fortable.
But Squire Bun, who was getting old

and stingy, and, besides, was in great want
of money, on account of his having lately
been made to pay swinging damages for
assaulting his neighbors and breaking their
heads —the squire, I say, finding Jona-
than was getting well to do in the world,
began to be very much troubled about his
welfare; so he demanded that Jonathan
should pay him a good rent for the land
which he had cleared and made good for
something. He trumped up I know not what
claim against him, and under different pre—
tences managed to pocket all Jonathau's
⁴ honest gains. In fact, the poor lad had not
a shilling left for holiday occasions; and had
it not been for the filial respect he felt for the
old man, he would certainly have refused to
submit to such impositions.

But for all this, in a little time, Jonathan
grew up to be very large of his age, and
became a tall, stout, double-jointed, broad-
footed cub of a fellow, awkward in his gait
and simple in his appearance3 but showing a
lively, shrewd look, and having the promise
of great strength when he should get his full
growth. He was rather an odd-looking chap,
in truth, and had many queer ways5 but
everybody that had seen John Bull saw a
great likeness between them, and swore he
was John’s own boy, and a true chip of the
old block. Like the old squire, he was apt

217

to bc blustering and saucy, but iu the main
was a peaceable sort of careless fellow, that
would quarrel with nobody if you only let
him alone. He used to dress in homespun
trousers with a huge bagging seat, which
seemed to have nothing 111 it. This made
people to say he had no bott0m; but whoever
said so lied, as they found to their cost when-
ever they put ›Jonathan in a passion, He
always wore a linsey-woolsey coat that did
not above half cover his brem-h, and the
sleeves of which were so short that his hand
and wrist came out beyond them, looking like
a shoulder of mutton. All which was in
consequence of his growing so fast that he
outgrew his clothes.

While J onathan was outgrowing his strength
in this way, Bull kept on pickiug his pockets
of every penny he could serape together; till
at last one day when the squire was even more
than usually pressing in his demands, which
116 accompanied with threats, Jonatha'n
started up in a furious passion, and threw the
TEA-KETTLE at the old man’s head. The
choleric Bull was hereupon exceedingly en-
r—agesh and after calling the poor lad an
undutifuL ungratefuL rebellious rascal, seized
him by the collar, and forthwith a furious
scullle ensued. This lasted a long time; for
the squire, though in years, was a capital
boxer, and of most excellent bottom. At
last, however, ‹Ionathan got him under, and
before he would let him up, made him sign a
paper, giving up all claim to the farms, and
acknowledgiug the see-simple to be in Jona-
than for ever.
