FEIACIA DOROTH EA HEMA N S.

familiarity with her sweet and simple lyrics has helped 10 keep her

memory green.

Lord Jeffrey pronounced her poetry “infinitely sweet, elegant and
tender‚ touehing and contemplative, rather than vehement or overpower-

ing. We do 1101 hesitate to say that she is the most touching and accom-
plished writer of occasional verses that our literature has yet to boast of.'’

THE SPARTANS’ MAROH.

The Spartans used not the truinpet 111 111011· 10111011 into 11111110, says Thucydides, because
they 111511011 not, 10 excite the rago of their warriors. Their ‹tharging—step was 11111110 to the

Dorian 10111111 of 1111105 and soft 1000111015.

9 W AS 1110111 upon 1110 Greeian hills, where
T peasants dressed the vines
Snnlight was on Cithaeron's 11115, Ar-
cadia’s rocks and pines.

And brightly, through 1115 100115 111111 11011015,
Eurotas wandered by,

NVhen 1150111111111050 sroni Sparta’s towers of
5111011111 harinony.

lVas it 1110 hunter's 01101111 511·11111,10 1110 110011-
land-goddess poured?

Did virgin hands, 111 Pallas' fane, strike the
full-smlnding ehord ⁸?

But hehns were glancing 1111 1110 stream. spears
ranged in close array,

And shields flung back a glorious 11011111 10 1110
nun-n ‹›f a fearful day

And the mountain 00111105 os the land swelled

through the deep-blne sky

 

 

While, to soi't stralus inoved forth a band of
10011 that inoved 10 die.

They niarelwd not with 1110 trnnipet’s blast,
11111· bado the horn peal out

And 1110 1110101-11101105,115 on they passed rung
with no battle shout.

They asked 110 ‹elarion's voice to 1110, their
50015 111111 an inipnlse high

But 1110 Dorian reed, and 1110 Spartan lyre,
for the sons of liberty !

And still 511001 110105, their path 111-0111111, sent
forth AEolian breath:

They needed not a sternet· sonnd to marshal
them for death 1

So moved they 01111111)γ 10 111011· field, thence
never 111 return,

Save bringing haek the Spartan shield, or on
it 11100111)ν borne!

THE HOUR OF DEATH.

And ssowers to wither 111 1110 north
wind's hreath,
And 511115 10 set—but all,
Thou 111151 1111 5011511115 for thine own, O

Death 1

LEAVES have their 11100 10 fall,

Day is for mortal care,

Eve for glad meetings round the joyous
hearth,

The banquet hath its honr,
115 foverish honr of inirth and song, and
wine:
There 001005 11 day for grief’s overwhelming
power.
A time for soster tears—but all are thine.

Youth and the opening rose

May look like things too glorious for de-
cay,

Night for the dreams of sleep, the voiee of And smile at thee—but thou art not of those

1111 'er-—
But 1111 1111· thee, thou mightiest os the earth.

That wait the ripened bloom to seize their
prey.
