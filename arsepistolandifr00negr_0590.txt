And Jullien’s band it tuck its stand
So sweetly in the middle there,

And sust bassoons played heavenly chunes,
And violins did fiddle there.

And when the Coort was tired of spoort,

A nate bufl‘et before them set,
Where 1115111115 of good dhrink there was!

At ten before the hall—roem door,
His moighty Excellency was;

He smoiled and bowed to all the crowd,
So gorgeous and immense he was.

His ‹lusky shuit, sublime and mute,
Into the door-way followed him ;

And O the 1111150 of the blackguard boys,
A>- they hurrood and hollowed him !

The noble (hair stud at the stair,
And hade 1110 dthrums to thump; and he
Did thus evince to that Black Prince
The welcoule of 1115 Company.

And hright the oys, you saw there, was;
And fixed each oye, ye there could spoi,
On Gineral Jung Bahawther was!

This Gineral great then tuek his sate,
With all the other ginerals,

All bleezed with precious minerals ;)

And as he there, with princely air,
Recloinin 011 1115 0115111011 was,

All round about his royal chair,
The squeezin and the pushin was.

And shake a fut with Fanny there!
