THE NEW SOU'I'H.

FROM AN ADDRESS DELIVERED AT A BANQUET OF THE NEW ENGLAND CLUB,
NEW YORK.

STAND here, Mr. President, to profess no
new loyalty. When General Lee, whose
heart was the temple of our hopes and

whose arm was clothed with our strength,
renewed his allegiance to the government
at Appomattox, he spoke from a heart too
great to be false, and he spoke for every honest
man from Maryland to Texas. From that
day to this, Hamilcar has nowhere in the
South sworn young Hannibal to hatred and
vengeance—but everywhere to loyalty and to

Ime the New South stands full-statured and

equal among the people of the earth, breath-
ing the kecn air and looking out upon an
expanding horizen, she understands that her
emancipation came because in the inscrutablc
wisdom of God her honest purpose was crossed
and her brave armies were beaten. This is
said in no spirit of time-serving and apology.
The South has nothing to take back; nothing
for which she has excuses to make. In my
native town of Athens is a monument that
crowns its central hills—a plain white shaft.

Deep cut into its shining sides is a name
dear to me above the names of men, that of a
brave and simple man who died in brave and
simple faith. Not for all the glories of New
England, from Plymouth Rock all the way,
would Ι exchange the heritage he left me in
his patriot's death. But, sir, speaking from
the shadow of that memory‚ which Ι honor as
I do nothing else on earth, Ι say that the
cause in which he suffered and for which he
gave his life was adjudged by higher and
fuller wisdom than 1113 01· mine, and Ι am glad
that the omniscient God held the balance of
battle in His almighty hand and that the
American Union was saved from the wreck
of war.

Witness the soldier standing at the base of
a Confederate monument above the graves of
his comi-ades, his empty sleeve tossing in the

April wind, adjuring the young men about
him to serve as honest and loyal citizens the
government against which their fathers fought.
This message, delivered from that sacred pres-
ence has gone home to the hearts of my fel-
lows! And, sir, Ι declare here, if physica]
courage be always equal to human aspira-
tions, that they would die, sir, if need be, to
restore this Republic their fathers fought to
dissolve!

This message, Mr. President‚ comes to you
from consecrated ground. What answer has
New England to this message! Will she per-
mit the prejudices of war to remain in the
hearts of the conquerorS‚ when it has died in
the hearts of the conquered‘? Will she trans-
mit this prejudice to the next generation, that
in hearts which never felt the generous ardor
of conflict it may perpetuate itself? Will she
withhold, save in strained courtesy, the hand
which straight from his soldier’s heart Grant
offered to Lee at Apponiattox? 117111 3116
make the vision of a restored and happy peo-
ple, which gathered about the couch of your
dying captain, filling his heart with peace,
touching his lips with praise‚ and glorifying
his path to the grave—will she make this
vision, on which the last sight of his expiring
soul breathed, a benediction‚ or a cheat and a
delusion ’.Ρ

If she does, the South‚ never abject in ask-
ing for comradeship, must accept with dignity
its refusal. But if she does not refuse to ac-
cept in frankness and sincerity this message of
good—will and friendship‚ then will the proph-
ecy of Webster, delivered to this very Society
forty years ago amid tremendous applause, be
verified in its fullest and final sense, when he
said: “Standing hand to hand and clasping'
hands, we should remain united as we have
been for sixty years, citizens of the same coun-
try, members of the same government, united,
all united now and united forever.’'
