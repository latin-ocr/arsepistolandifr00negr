Tell me, ye who tread the sods of yon
sacred height, is XVarren dead? Can you not
still see him—not pale and prostrate, the
blood of his gallant heart pouring out of his

AMERIOAN EXPERIMENT OF SELF-GOVERNMENT.
ONE might almost think, without extrava- sight. They exhort us, they adjure us, to be

gance, that the ‹leparted wise and

good, of all places and 1111105, are look-
1111,Γ down from their happy scats to witness
what shall now 110 donc by us ; that they who
lavishcd their treasures, and their blood, of old
—who spake and wrote, who labored, fought
and perished, in 1110 0110 great cause of srcedoin
and truth—are now hanging, froin their orbs
on high, over the last solemn experiment of
humanity.

As I have wandered over the spots once the
sceno of 111011· 11111015, and lnused among the
prostrate columns of their senate-houses and
forulns, I have seemed almost to hear a voice
from the tombs of departed ages, from the
sepulchres of 1110 nations which died before the

faithful to our trust.

They implore us, by the long trials of strug- ⁷
gling humanity ; by the 111055οᾶ memory of the '-
departed; by the dear saith which has been '
plighted by pure hands to the holy cause of
truth and nian3 by the awful 5001015 of the j

been 1111111 u red by the noble heads which have
been brought to the block ; by the wrecks of
time, by the eloquent ruins of nations-they ²·
conjure us not to quench the light which is ris·
