Labor is health l——Lol the husbandman
reaping‚

How through his veins goes the life-current
leaping!

How his strong arm in its stalwart pride
sweeping,

True as a sunbeam the swift sickle guides.
Labor is wealth—in the 363 1116 pearl groweth;
Rich the queen’s robe from the frail cocoon

floweth ;
From the fine acorn the strong forest bloweth ;

Temple and statue the marble block hides.

Droop not, though 31131116, 3111, and anguish
are round thee;

Bravely fling off the cold chain that hath
bound thee 1

Look to you pure heaven smiling beyond
thee:

Rest not content 111 thy darkness—a clod!
Work for some good, be it ever so slowly;
Cherish some flmver, 116 it ever 30 lowly:
Labor l—all labor 13 noble and holy ;

Let glyd great deeds be thy prayer 111 thy

ID the fiower-wreathed tombs I stand,
Bearing lillies in my hansl.
Oomrades! 111 what soldier-grave
Sleep the bravest of the brave‘?

Is it he who sank to rest

With his colors round his breast?
Friendship makes his tomb a shrine,
Garlands 17611 it ; ask not mine.

One low grave, yon trees beneath,
Bears no roses, wears no wreath ;
Yet no heart more high and warm
Ever dared the battle-storin.

Never gleamed a prouder eye
In the front of victory ;

 

Never foot had firmer tread
On the field where hope lay dead,

Thau are hid within 11113 1011111,
11Ῑ11616 1116 1111161111611 grasses bloom ;
And no stone, with feigned distress,
Mocks the sacred 101161111633.

Youth and beauty, dauntless will,
Dreams 111111 life could ne’er fulfil,
Here lie buried——here in peace
XVrongs and woes have found release.

Turning from my comrades’ eyes,
Kneeling where a woman lies,

I strew lillies on the grave

Of the bravest of the brave.

WAS on Lake Erie’s broad expanse,
One bright, midsummer day,
The gallant steamer Ocean Queen
Swept proudly on her way.

Bright faces clustered on 1116 deck,
Or leaning o’er the side,

Watehed carelessly 1116 feathery foam,
'sliat flecked the rippling tide.
