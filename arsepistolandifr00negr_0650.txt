A ROUGH RHYME ΟΝ A ROUGH MA'I'TER.
THE ENGLISH GAME LAws.

THE merry brown hares came leaping She watched a long tuft of clover,

Over the erest of the hill, Where rabbit or hare never ran,
Where the clover and corn lay sleeping‚ For its blaok sour haulm covered over
Under the moonlight still. The blood of a murdered man.
Leaping late and early, She thought of the dark plantation,
'sill under their bite and their tread, And the hares, and her husband's blood,
The swedes, and the wheat, and the barley And the voice of her indignation
Lay cankered, and trampled‚ and dead. Rose up to the throne of God.
A poacher's widow sat sighing ‘⁸ I am long past wailing and whining,—
On the side of the white chalk bank, I have wept too much in my life:
Where, under the gloomy fir—woods, I’ve had twenty years of pining
One spot in the lea throve rank. As an English laborer's wife.
