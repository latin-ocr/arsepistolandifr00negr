ROBERT BURNS. 477

“ O man, while 111 thy early years,
How prodigal of time!

Misspending all thy precious hours,
Thy glorious youthful prime!

Alternate follies take the sway:
Licentious passions burn ;

1171111311 ten-sold force gives nature's law,
That man was made to mourn.

“ Look not alone on youthful prime,
Or manhood’s active might3

Man then is useful to his kind
Supported in his right;

But see him on the edge of life,
With cares and sorrows worn,

Then age and want, O ill—matched pair!
Show man was made to mourn.

“ A few seem favorites of fate,
In pleasure’s lap carest3

Yet think not all the rich and great
Are likewise truly blest.

But, oh, what crowds in every land
Are wretched and forlorn!

Through weary life this lesson learn—
That man was made to mourn.

‘⁶ Many and sharp the numerous ills,
Inwoven with our frame!

More pointed still we make ourselves,
Regret, remorse, and shame!

And man, whose heaven-elected face
The smiles of love adorn,

Man’s inhumanity to man
Makes countless thousands mourn!

 

“ Sec yonder poor, o'erlaborcd wight,

So abject, mean and vile,

117110 begs a brother of the earth
To give him leave to toil;

And see his lordly fellow-worm
The poor petition spurn,

Unmindful, ’though 11 weeping wife
And helpless oflspring mourn.

“ If I’m desig-ned yon lordling’s slave—

, By nature’s law designes]—

11711)7 was an independent wish
E'er planted in my mind?

If not, why am I subject to
His cruelty and scorn?

Or why has man the will and power
To make his fellow mourn?

“ Yet let not this too much, my son,

Disturb thy youthful hreast:

This partial view of humankind
Is surely not the last!

The poor, oppressed, yet honest man
Had never, sure, been born,

Had there not been some recompense
To comfort those that mourn 1

‘¹ O death! the poor man’s dearest friend,

The kindest and the best!
11701001110 the hour my age-d limbs
Are laid with thee at rest!
The great, the wealthy, fear thy blow,
From pomp and pleasure torn ;
But, oh, a blest relief to those
That weary-laden mourn 1 ”

COTS, wha hae wi' 1171111000 bled ;
Scots‚ wham Bruce has asten led ;
117010011ιο to your gory bed,

Or to victorie!

Now's the day, and now’s the hour;

See the front o' battle lower;

See approach proud Edward’s power:
Chains and slaverie 1

Wha will be a traitor knave?
Wha can fill a coward’s grave?

Wha sae base as be a slave?
Let him turn and fiee 1

Wha for Scotland’s king and law,
F reedom’s sword will strongly draw,
Freeman stand, or freeman fa’l

Let him follow me!

By oppression’s woes and pains!
By your sons 111 servile chains!
We will drain our dearest veins,
But they shall be free!

Lay the proud usurpers low!
Tyrants fall in every foe!
Liberty’s 111 every blow!

Let us do, or die!
