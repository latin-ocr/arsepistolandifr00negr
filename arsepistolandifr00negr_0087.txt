'EDGAR ALLAN POE. 61

A discriminating critic has characterized Poe as “ perfectly poetic in
his own province. 1f his circle is narrow, it is a magic one. His poetry
is sheer poetry and borrows nothing from without.''

After a life of singular vicissitude and “ unmerciful disaster, caused

mainly by his own passions aud weaknesses‚ Poe died at Baltimore
October 7th‚ 1849.
