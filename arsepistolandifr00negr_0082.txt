EDGAR ALLAN ΡΟΕ.

The Erratic and Brilliant Genius

 

admired and much lamented author, Edgar Allen Poe. At
times he blazed brightly, again went under a cloud, and at every
stage of his progress and achievements awakened surprise, and
after burning in fitful splendor sank into the darkness of an
early grave. The productions of his weird and mysterious

 

genius have survived.
The eminent author, Paul Hamilton Hayne, says of Edgar A. Poe:

“ Two mighty spirits dwelt in him :
One, a wild demon, weird and dim,
The darkness of whose ebou wings
Did shroud unuttenable things ·
One, a fait· angel, in the skies

Of whose serene, unshadowed eyes
VVere seen the lights of Paradise.

To these, in turn, he gave the whole
Vast empire of his brooding soul ;

Now, filled with strains of heavenly swell,
Now thrilled with awful tones of hell:
Wide were his being’s strange extremes,
’Twixt nether glooms, and Eden gleams
Of tendet, or majestic dreams.''

Poe was born in Baltiinore, February 19, 1809. ’ His family was one
of the oldest and most respectable in that city. David Poe, his paterna]

grandfather, was a quartermaster-general in the Maryland line during the ÷
Revolution, and the intimate friend of Lafayette‚ who, during his last visit ’
to the United StateS‚ called personally upon the general's widow, and 1
tendered her his acknowledgments for the services rendered to him by her ἶ
husband. His father and mother died within a few weeks of each other,
of consumption, leaving him an orphan, at two years of age. Mr. John
