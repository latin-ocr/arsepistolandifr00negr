ALFRED AUSTIN.

601

For you have circled earth with pinions fleet, And though the shade of treasonable strife

The seasons through; and everywhere a
Of gloiirlihgnghearts your coming trooped to
Withgzffvzem and song.

Over the unchanging sea eight changeful

’ Ηανὲῃῐῖιῗῗθά from shield to sickle, seed to
sheaves ;

And twice a hundred dawns, a hundred noons,

A hundred eves

Waned to their slumber in the starlit night.
And ever from land or lake, from wave or
cra ,
From ΗΧΕΞ or floating fort you had in sight
The British flag.

And wider, further onward round the world,
Scouring the field or furrowing the sea,
You found that emblem, which, where’er
unfurled,
Floats o’er the free.

So that on man and man's laborious hand
Nor manacle nor hindrance shall be laid,
But mind with mind and strand with gener-
ous strand
Contend and trade.

Falls on our homes and theirs you, wander-
Youngnizffixiiaihvdnwealths you found, surging
with life,
Yet ruled by law,

Whose blood infused in ours in war's emprise
To vindicate one sceptre, sword and tongue,
As ours perchance may help to keep them
W1se,
Hath made us young.

Fountain of youth England in mellower years
Hath found and drained, so that she ne’er
need know
What nature feels when Autumn stacks and
Or {iil-{sgusts blow.

You sailed from us to them, from them to
us,
Love at the prow and Wisdom at the helm,
August ambassadors‚ who strengthen thus
Her rule and realm 1

Round you to-day a people stand arrayed
That fain with peace two wedded worlds
would dower3

Therefore rejoicing mightier hath been made
Imperial power!
