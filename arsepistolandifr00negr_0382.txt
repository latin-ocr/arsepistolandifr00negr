LEW WALLACE.
Author of “The Fair God ” and “ Ben Hur.''

 

T does not require a multitude of books to give an author a
reputation. Alexander Smith represents his hero as praying

world and the ages. That would be enough3 and it must be
admitted that one good book is more to be desired than a thou-

 

sand poor ones. One oak is a grander product of nature than
a million mushrooms.

Nor is it essentia] that a man to be a successful author must begin
his career early in life. Whenever this point is touched upon Sir Walter
Scott is almost sure to be mentioned, whose grand achievements all came
into the last half of his life. So Hawthorne might be named, whose
“ Scarlet Letter'' gave him reputation at the age of forty-six, and unveiled
a striking figure on the literary horizon.

General Lew. Wallace had been known as a soldier and lawyer
before, as Carlisle would say, he became “ a maker of books.'' Especially
was Mr. WVallace interested in the Mexican War, and his persona] ser-
vices were such as to predict for him a brilliant career as a soldier if
opportunity should ever be offered. The opportunity came in connection
with our Civil W ar, and Mr. Wallace rose to the position of Brigadier-
General and then Major-Genera] of volunteers.

He was born in Brookville‚ 1nd., April 10, 1827, and, after receiving
a thorough education‚ studied law. During the Mexican War he entered
the army as first lieutenant. Thereafter he practiced his profession at
Covington and Crawfordsville until the beginning of the Civil War, When
he was appointed Adjutant-General of Indiana, and became Colone] of
volunteerS. Subsequently he was commissioned Brigadier-General and
then Major-Genera] of volunteers. He was at the capture of Fort Don-
elsou and Shssoh, and in 1863 prevented the capture of Cincinnati by the
Confederates. His troops were defeated at the battle of Monocacy July

9, 1864, and he was removed from his command by General Halleck, but

was reinstated by General Grant.
