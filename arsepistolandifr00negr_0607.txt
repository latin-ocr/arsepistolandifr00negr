JoHN MmoN.
Author of “ paradise Lost.''

 

²⁵ 1³ss ³ HE famous author of the greatest religious epic in the English
Ψ language, was born in London‚ December 9, 1608, and died
there November 8, 1674. The son of a scrivener, he yet
received a thorough classical education, attending St. Paul's
School until 1624 and graduating from Christ’s College‚ Cam-
bridge, in 1629. His first poetic efforts date from his college
days, when he wrote his “Ode on the Nativity‚'' and his “ Sonnet to
Shakespeare.'’

For six years after his graduation he devoted himself to literature at
Horton‚ near Windsor‚ producing ‘⁴ Ad Patren1‚'' “ L'Allegro‚'‘ “ Il Pen-
seroso,'’ “ Comus '' and ‘⁶ Lycidas.” In 1638 he made a trip to Italy, but
was recalled the following year by the Scottish war. “ Paradise Lost‚'' his
masterpiece‚ was conceived in 1640, but was not actually begun till 1658.
It was completed in 1665 and published 1667. He sold his rights in the
poem to Samuel SimmonS‚ printer, for twenty-five dollars down and the
promise of three subsequent payments of the same amount. “ Paradise
Regained ’' and “Samson Agonistes ’' appeared 111 1671. Milton was
also a forceful writer of English prose. From 1652 he was totally blind.

The original contract by which Milton signed away his interest in
one of the most famous poems ever penned, is to be seen 111 1116 British
Museum 111 London‚ and, as may well be imagined, is an object of great
curiosity. If the fame of this production‚ 111 which the dazzling genius
displayed is undisputed, could have been foreseen, it would have brought
a fortune to its author instead of the paltry sum for which the copyright
was sold—another instance, of which many are on record, of the under-
value placed upon literary works and the impossibility of guessing
whether they are destined to great success or doomed to pitiable failure.

Milton was a stern old Puritan. His nature was cast in a religious
mould. His mind was foreordained, to use a Calvinistic expression, to
create the lofty imaginings that awe and dazzle us. His style is seldom

easy and simple3 it is severe, at times stilted, barren of pathos except in
