HENRY W. SHAW.

Known as “Josh Billings.”

 

1 ’ ARK TWAIN once remarked that he knew a man who always
spelled “ cow ’⁷ with a capital “ K‚'’ and he did not see why this
Γ s was not quite as correct as to spell it with a small “ k.'' The
⁴ -‘ ’ἶ ‘⁹ quaint spelling adopted by some authors, notably Artemus
Ward and Josh Billings, has had much to do with the popular-
ity of their productions.

Mr. Shaw was a son of a member of the Massachusetts Legislature
and Congressman, and was born April 21, 1818. Having entered Hamil-
ton College he soon tired of a student's life and ran away to lead a roving
life in the West. At one time he was a dealer in coal3 again, a farmer;
and then a steamboat captain, finally settling in Poughkoepsie, N. Y„ as
a real-estate agent and auctioneer. He wrote an “ Essay on the Mule‚’'
which received no attention3 then adopting dialectic spelling his “Essa
on the Muel‚ by Josh Billings‚'' was reproduced in half the newspapers
throughout the country.

He became popular as a lecturer by his homely humor, plain common
sense and droll manner. He published “Josh Billings, 1115 Sayings;''
“Josh Billings on Ice‚'' “ Every Boddy's Friend‚’' “ Trump Kards,”
“Josh Billings' Spice-Box‚'' and in 1869 “Josh Billings' Allminax,''
which continued for ten years with an average circulation of over 100,000
copies 3 year. He died at Monterey, California, in 1885.
