WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE. 539

That patient merit of the unworthy takes, sp And makes us rather bear those ills we have,
When he himself might his quietus make Thau fly to others that we know not of?

With a bare bodkin? who would fardels s Thus conscience does make cowards of us all ;
bear, ¹ And thus the native hue of resolution
To grunt and sweat under a weary life, Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought;

But that the dread of something after death—— And enterprises of great pith and moment,
That undiscovered country, from whose bourn With this rcgard, their currente turn awry,
No traveller returns‚——puzzles the will, 1 And lose the name of action.

WHERE THE BEE SUOKS.
FROM “THE TEMPEST.”

HERE the bee sucks, there suck Ι : Ι After summer, merrily.
In a cowslip's bell Ι lie; Merrily, merrily shall Ι live now,
There I conch when owls ‹lo cry. Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.

On the bat's back I do fly

GRABBED ΑΘΕ AND YOUTH.

RABBED age and youth Youth is nilnhle, age is lame;
Cannot live together ; Youth is hot and bold,
Youth is full of pleasance, Age is weak and cold ;
Age is full of care3 Youth is wild, and age is tame,
Youth like summer morn, Age, I do abhor thee ;
Age like winter weather ; Youth, I do adore thee;
Youth like summer brave, O, my love, my love is young!
Age like winter bare. Age, Ι do defy thee ;
Youth is full of sport, O, sweet shepherdl hie thee,
Age’s breath is short ; For methinks thou stay’st too long.

INFLUENOE OF MUSIG.

RPHEUS, with his lute made trees, ’χ Every thing that heard him play,
O And the mountain-tops that freeze, ι Even the billows of the sea,
Bow themselves when he did sing; Hung their heads, and then lay by.
To his music plants and flowers In sweet music is such art,
Ever sprung, as sun and showers Killing care, and grief of beart—-

There had made a lasting Spring. Fau asleep‚ or, hearing, die!
