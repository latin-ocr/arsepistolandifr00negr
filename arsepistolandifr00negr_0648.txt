600 ALFRED AUSTIN.

While over orchard daffodils And the owlet hoots from hollow stump,
Cloud-shadows float and fleet, And the dormouse makes its bed ;

And ΟΠΖΘῙ ΡῙΡΘΒ and laVffl'OOk trin& When crammed are all the granary fioors,
And young lambs buck and bleat;

So long as that which bursts the bud,
And swells and tunes the rill,

Makes springtime in the maiden’s blood,
Life is worth living still.

And the hunter's moon is bright,
And life again is sweet iudom-s,
And logs again alight;
Aye, even when the houseless wind
Waileth through cleft and chink,

Life not worth living! Come with me, And in the tWilight maidss grow kind»
Now that, through vanishing veil, And jugs are filled and clink ;
Shinnncrs the dew on lawn and lea, When children clasp their hands and pray,
And milk foams in the pail ; “ Be done Thy heavenly will! ”
Now that June's sweltering sunlight bathes thO (loth 110ίὶ lift his voice and say,
With sweat the triplings lithe, “ Life is worth living still? ”
As fall the long, straight, scented swathes
Over the rhythmic scythe ; Is life worth living? Yes, so long
Now that the throstle never stops As there is wrong to right,
His sels-sufficing strain, Wail of the weak against the strong,
And woodbine-trails festoon the eopse, Or tyranny to fight ;
And eglantine the lane ; Long as there lingers gloom to chase‚
Now rustic labor seems as sweet Or streaming tear to dry,
As leisure‚ and blithe herds One kindred woe, one sorrowing face
lVent horneward with unweary feet, That smiles as we draw nigh 3
Carolling like the birds ; Long as a tale of anguish swells
Now all, except the lover's vow, The heart and lids grow wet,
And nightingale, is still ; And at the sound of Christmas bells
Here, in the starlit hour, allow, We pardon and forget3
Life is worth living still. So long as faith with sreedom reigns,
And loyal hope survives‚
When summer, lingering half-forlorn, And graeious charity remains
On autumn loves to lean, To leaven lowly lives;
And fields of slowly yellowing corn While there is one untrodden tract
Are girt by woods still green ; For intellect or will,
then hazelnuts wax brown and plump, And men are free to think and act,
And apples rosy-red, Life is worth living still.
