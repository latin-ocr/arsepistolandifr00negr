cers walked up and down, aud directed the
men in the trenches at their feet with the air
of judges or time-keepers at an athletic meet-
ing, who were observing a tug-of-war·

Others exposed themselves in what looked
like a spirit of braggadoeiO, for they moved
with a swagger and called upon the men 10
notice how bravc they were. Other officers
rose only when it was necessary to observe
some fresh movement upon the part. of the
enemy, and they did this without the least
haste and simply as a part of their work, and
regarded the bullets that instantly beset them
as little as if they were 80 many flies.

A Turkish soldier dragging a mule loaded
with ammunition had appeared a quarter of a
mile below 118, 111111 at sight of him the soldiers
at once recognized that there was something
tangible, something that could show 801110 sign
if they hit it.. The white smoke they had
aimed at before had ssoated away, but at the
sight of this individual soldier the entire line
ceased {iring at the enemy’s trenehes, and
opened on the unhappy Turk and his mule,
111111 as the dust spurted up at points nearer
and nearer to where he stood, their excitement
increased in proportion‚ until, when he gave
the mule a kiek and ran for his life, there was
a triumphant shout all along the line, 118
though they had repulsed a regiment. That
one man and his lond of ammunition had for
11 few minutes represented to them the entire
T urkish army.

As the Turks suddenly appeared below us,
elambering out of a long gully, it was as

though they had sprung from the earth. On
the moment the smiling landscape changed
like a scene at a theatre, and hundreds of men
rose from what had apparently been deserted
hilltops‚ and stood outliued in silhoutte against
the sunset, waves of smoke ran from erest to
erest, spitting flashes of red flame, and men's
voices shrieked and shouted, and the Turkish
shells raeed each other so fiereely that they
beat out the air until it groaned. It had
come up so suddenly that it was like two dogs
springing at each other's throats, and, in a
greater degree, it had something of the sound
of two wild animal struggling for life.

Volley answered volley as though with per-
sonal hate—one erashing in upon the roll of
the other, or beating it out of recognition with
the bursting roar of heavy cann0n3 and to
those who could do nothing but 110 face down-
wards and listen to it, it seemed as though
they had been caught in a burning lmilding,
and that the walls and roof were falling in on
them.

I do not know how long it lasted—-probably
not more than five minutes, although it seemed
much longer than that—but finally the death-
grip seemed to relax, the volleys came brok-
enly, like a man panting for breath‚ the bul·
lets eeased to sound with the hiss of escaping
steam, and rnstled aimlessly by, and from hill-
top to hilltop the officers' whistles sounded as
though a sportsman were calling off his dogS.
The Turks had been driven back, and for the

fourth day the Greeks had held Velestino suc·
cessfully against them.
