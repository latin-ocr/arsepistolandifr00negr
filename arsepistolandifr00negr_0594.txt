THOMAS Hooo.
Who Sang “The Song of the Shirt.”

 

. AYS W. M. Rossetti—and he is acknowledged authority on all
’ i questions relating to literature—“ As a poet and humorist Hood
⁸ . has touched the universal heart. His two productioris, ‘Song
'³⁸' of the Shirt' and ‘ Bridge of Sighs‚' are sufficient to give him
immortal fame, even if he had written nothing else. It has
been well said that the predominant characteristics of Hood’s
genius are humorous fancies grafted upon melancholy impressions. Yet
the term ‘grafted‘ is hardly strong enough. Hood appears by natural
bent and permanent habit of mind to have seen and sought for ludicrous-
ness under all conditions; it was the first thing that struck him. ,

“On the other hand, his nature being poetic, his ,sympathies acute, ⁴
and the condition of his life morbid, he very frequently wrote in a tone of
deep melancholy feeling, and was a master both of his own art and of the
reader's emotion. Sometimes, not very often, we are allowed to reach the
close of a poem of his without having our attention jogged and called off
by something grotesque, and then we feel how exquisite a poetic sense ⁷
and choice a cunning of hand were his. On the whole we can pronounce
him the finest English poet between the generation of Shelley and the
generation of Tennyson.''

Hood was born in London in 1798 and died in 1845. His lot was
hard in early life, and this often gave a melancholy tinge to his genuine
native humor. As a punster he was unrivalled.

 

 

THE SONG OF THE SHIR'I'.

ITH fingers weary and worn, 5Vork! work! work!
v v With eyelids heavy and red, While the coek is crowing aloof!
A woman sat, 111 unwomanly ragS‚ And work-work—work,
Plying her needle and thread— Till the stars 5111110 through the roof!
Stitch! stiteh! stitch ! It’s O! to be a slave
In poverty‚ hunger, and dirt; Along with the barbarous Turk,
And still with a voice of dolorous pitch Where woman has never a soul to save,

She sang the “ Song of the Shirt 1 ’' If this 15 Christian work!
