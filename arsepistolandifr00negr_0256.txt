203 ALICE AND PHOEBE CARY.

That saith to me a courage gives
Low as the grave to go ;

I know that my Redeemer lives;
That I shall live I know.

 

The palace walls I almost see,
VVhere dwells my Lord and King3
Oh, grave, where is thy victory?
Oh, death, where is thy sting?

Amor: CARY.

PICTURES OF MEMORY.

MONG the beautiful pietures
That hang on Memory's wall
Is one of a dim old forest,
That seenwth hest of all;
Not for its gnarled oaks olden,
Dark with the lnistletoe;
Not for the violets golden
That sprinkle the vale below ;
Not for the milk-white lilies
That lean from the fragrant ledge,
Coquetting all day with the sunbeams,
And stealing their golden edge ;
Not for the vines on the upland,
there the bright red berries rest,
Nor the pinks, nor the pale sweet cowslip,
It seemeth to me the best.

I once had a little brother,

With eyes that were dark and deep ;
In the lap of that old dim forest

He lieth in peace asleep:

 

Light as the down of the thistle,
Free as the winds that blow,
We roved there the beautiful summers,
The summers of long ago ;
But his feet on the hilis grew Weary,
And, one of the autumn eves,
I made for my little brother
A bed of the yellow leaves.
Sweetly his pale arms folded
My neck in a meek embrace‚
As the light of immortal beauty
Silently covered his face;
And when the arrows of sunset
Lodged in the tree-tops bright,
He fell, in his saint-like beauty,
Asleep by the gates of light.
Tlierefore, ‹›f all the pictures
T hat hang on Memory’s wall,
The one of the dim old forest
Seemeth the best of all.

Amen CARY.

SUPPOSE.

UPPOSE‚ my little lady,
Your doll should break her head,
Gould you make it whole by crying
Till your nose and eyes were red?
And wouldn't it be pleasanter
To treat it as a joke‚
And say you're glad ’twas dolly's,
And not your own head that’s broke?

Suppose you’re dressed for walking
And the rain comes pouring down,
Will it clear off any sooner
Because you scold and frown?
And wouldn’t it be nicer
For you to smile thau pout,
And so make sunshine in the house
When there is noue without?

Suppose your task‚ my little man,
Is very hard to get,
will it make it any easier
For you to sit and fret?
And wouldn’t it he wiser
Than waiting like a dunce,
To go to work in earliest
And learn the thing at once?

Suppose that some boys have a horse,
And some a eoaoh and pair,

Will it tire you less while walking
To say, “It isn’t fair? ''

And wouldn’t it be nobler
To keep your temper sweet,

And in your beart bo thankful
Yon can walk upon your feet?
