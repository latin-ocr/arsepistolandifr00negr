SIR WALTER SCOTT. 525

took the opportunity of reading to him the first canto of the ‘Lady of the
Lake,' in order to ascertain the effect the poem was likely to produce

upon a person who was but too favorable a representative of readers at
large. It is, of course, to be supposed, that I determined rather to guide
my opinion by what my friend might appear to feel, than by what he
might think fit to say.

“His reception of my recitation, or prelection, was rather singular.
He placed his hand across his brow, and listened with great attention
through the whole account of the stag hunt, till the dogs threw them-

and luxurious power—never was the illusion of fancy so complete—made
up of so many minute elementS,—-and yet producing such entireness of
