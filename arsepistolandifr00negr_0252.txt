mistakable, that says to thee that thy beloved
is no longer thine.

On the face of the child, however, there
was no ghastly imprint—only a high and
almost sublime expression, the overshadowing
presence of spiritual natures, the dawning of
immortal life in that childish soul.

They stood there so still, gazing upon her,
that even the ticking of the watch sccnlcd
too loud. In a few moments Tom returned
with the doctor. He entered, gave one look,
and stood silent as the rcst.

“ When did this change take place? '' said
he, in a low whisper to Miss Ophelia.

“About the turn of the night,'’ was the
reply.

Marie, roused by the entrance of the doctor,
appeared hurriedly from the next room.
“Augustinel Consin! Oh, what!” she hur-
riedly began.

“Hush 1 '' said St. Clare, hoarsely; “ she ,23

Mammy heard the words and flew to
awaken the servants. The house was soon
rouscd. Lights were seen, footstcps heard,
anxious faces thronged ihc vcranda and
looked tearfully through the glass (loors, but
St. Clare heard and said nothing. He saw
only that look on the face of the little sleeper.

“Oh, if she would only wake and speak
once more!'’ he said; and stooping over her
he spokc in her ear, “ Eva, darling.’'

The large hlue eyes unclosed ; a smilc passed
over her face; she tried to raise her head and
speak.

“ Do you know me, Eva? ’'

“ Dear papa,'’ said the child with a last
effort, throwing her arms about his neck. In

a moment they dropped again, and as St. Clare
raised his head he saw a spasm of mortal
agon y pass over the faee; she struggled for
breath and threw up her little hands.

“O God, this is dreadful!'’ he said, turn- ’

ing away iu agony and wringing Tom’s hand,
scarce conscious what he was doing. “Oh,
Toni, my boy, it is killing me ἔ ”

Tom had his master‘s hands between his
own, and, with tears streaming down his dark
cheeks, looked up for help where hc had
always been used to look. .

“Pray that this may be cut sli‹›rt,'' said St. ’
Clare. “ This wrings my heart l ” ’

“Oh, hless the Lord! it’s over, it's over, ’

dcar master? said T01u; “look at her.'’

The child lay panting on her pillows as one ⁵
exhausted, the large, clear eyes rolled up and ⁴

fixed. Ah, what said those eyes that spoke

so much of heaven? Earth was past, aud ’

earthly pain3 but so solemn, so mysterious
was the triumphant brightness of that face
that it checked even the sobs of sorrow. They
pressed around her in breathless stillness.

‘⁴ Eva.,'' said St, Clare, gently. She did not
hear.

“ Oh, Eva, tell us what you see. What is ”
it? '’ said her father. ,

A bright, a glorious smile passed over her —
face, and she said brokenly, “Oh, love, joy,
peace! '' gave one sigh, and passed from death
unto life.

Farewell, beloved child. The bright, eter-
nal doors have closed after thee; we shall see
thy sweet face no more. Oh, woe for them who
watched thy entrance into heaven when they

shall wake and find only the cold, gray sky   ζ·

“ONLY A YEAR.”

NE year ago‚—a ringing voice,
A clear blue eye,

And clustering curls of sunny hair,
Too fair to die.

Only a year—no voice, no smile‚
No glauce of eye,

No clustering curls of golden hair,
Fair but to die!

Ono year ago—what loves, what schemes
Far into life!

What joyous hopes, what high resolves,
What generous strife!

The silent picture on the wall,
The burial-stone ⁶

Of all that beauty, life, and joy,
Remain alone!
