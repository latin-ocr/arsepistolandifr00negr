to his angels who stood about his throne, he
said, ‘ take him, strip him of his robes of flesh;
cleanse his affections; put a new breath into
his nostril3 but touch not his human beart——
the beart that sears, and hopes, and trembles.’
A moment, and it was done, aud the man
stood ready for his unknown voyage. Under
the guidanee of a mighty angel, with sounds
of flying pinions, they sped away from the
battlements of heaven. Some time, on the
mighty angel's wings, they fled through
Saharas of darknesses, wilderness of death.

NEVER TROUBLE TROUBLE'.

Y good man is a elever man,

Which no one will gainsay ;

He lies awake to plot and plan
’Gainst lions in the way,

While I, without a thought of ill,
Sleep sound enough for three ;

For Ι never trouble trouble till
Trouble troubles me.

A holiday we never fix
But he 15 sure 'twill rain,
And when the sky 15 clear at six
He knows it won’t remain.
He's always prophesying ill,
To which I won’t agree,
For I never trouble trouble till
Trouble troubles me.

T he wheat will never show a top—
But soon how green the field!
We will not harvest half a crop—
Yet have a famous yield !

It will not seli, it never will!
But Ι will wait and see,

For I never trouble trouble till
Trouble troubles me.

He has a sort of second sight,
And when the fit is strong,

He sees beyond the good and right
The evil and the wrong,

Heaven's cup of joy he'll surely spill
Unless I with him be,

For I never trouble trouble till
Trouble troubles me.
