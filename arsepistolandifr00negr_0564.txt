The “ Bard of Erin,''

 

WHE “Bard of Erin,'' Ireland's sweetest singen famous as the
1Ἰ ,

author of “The Last Rose of Summer,'' and many other
delightful lyrics‚ was born 111 Dublin, May 28, 1779, and was
educated at T rinity College. He first attracted public atten-
tion by his translation of Anacreon in 1800, and he achieved
his first great success by the publication of his “ Irish Melo-
dies,” which brought him 32500 per annum. He was married to an
actress, Bessy Dyke, shortly before the publication, in 1817, of “Lalla
Rookh,'’ a poem which created a sensation at the time and upon which
his fame chiefly rests.

Moore at this time was clerk of the admiralty court of Bermuda,
although living in England. His deputy embezzled ᾖ30,000 and Moore
fied to Italy to avoid arrest. He returned to England soon, however, and
in 1835 was granted a pension of ffi1,5oo. He died February 25, 1852.
His last days were shadowed by the death of his two sons and by his
own mental weakness. His “ History of Ireland'' was his chief prose
work, although a number of his lampoons and short comic sketches were
very successful. In 1803—4 he visited America and was cordially received.

His ‘⁶ Meinoirs, Journals and Correspondence’' were published by Earl
Russell in 1853—56.

 

From another biographical sketch of the poet we extract the following:
“ ‘The Bard of Erin' was the son of a Catholic grocer. He was sent
to the same school where Sheridan was educated and where he himself
became ‘a determined rhymer.' After studying at Trinity College, he
went to London and in 1800 published a translation of ‘ Anacreon,’ which
he dedicated to the Prince of Wales, his patron then, but the butt of his
satire afterward. It proved a great hit, and, with his musical talent,
opened his way into the best society.
“ He published ‘Odes and Epistles’ in 1806, and from 1807 to 1834
produced his popular ‘Irish Melodies,' which have given him a place ’

amongb the first English poets and superior to any other in his native
5 .
