ged exterior humanity wore its sweetest smile.
There was for a long time hardly a lawyer in
the land. The husbandman who held his own
plough, and fed his own cattle, was the great
man of the age; no one was superior to the
matron, who, with her busy daughters, kept
the hum of the wheel incessantly alive,
spinuing and weaving every article of their
dress.

Fashion was confinesl within narrow limits;
and pride, which aimed at no grander equi-
page thau a pillion‚ could exult only in the
common splendor of the blue and white linen
gown, with short sleeves‚ coming down to the
waist‚ aud in the snow-white flaxen apron,
which, primly starched and ironed, was worn
on public days by every woman in the land.
For there was no revolution except from the
time of sowing to the time of reaping3 from
tho plain dress of the week day to the more
trim attile of Sunday.

Every family was taught to look upward
to God, as to the Fountain of all good. Yet
life was not sombre. The spirit of f101i0 ming-
led with innocence; religion itself somtimes

 

THE HUGUENO'I'S IN CAROLINA.

HAT need of describing the stripes, the
W roastings by slow fires, the plunging
into wells, the gashes from kuives,
the wounds from red-hot pincers, and all the
cruelties employed by men who were only for-
bidden not to ravish nor to kill? The loss of
lives cannot be computed. How many thou-
sands of men, how many thousands of children
and women, perished in the attempt to escape,
who cau tell? An histor-ian has asserted that
ten thou=and perished at the stake, or on the
gibbet and the wheel.

But the efforts of tyranny were powerless.
Truth enjoys serenely her own immortality;
aud opinion, which always yields to a clearer
conviction, laughs violence to scorn. The un-
paralleled persecution of vast masses of men
for their religious creed, occasioned but a new
display of the power of humanity; the Cal-
viuists preserved their faith over the ashes of
their churches, and the bodies of their mur-
dered ministers.

wore the garb of gayety; and the annual 1
thanksgiving to God was, from primitive ἱ
times, as joyous as it was sincere. Nature
always asserts her rights, and abounds in means
of gladness.

The frugality of private life had its influ-
ence on publicexpenditure. Half a century
after the concession of the character, the an-
nual expenses of the government did not ex-
ceed eight hundred pounds, or four thousand
dollars; and the wages of the chief justice'
were 1011 shillin gs a day while ou service. In
each county a magistrate acted as judge of
probate, and the business was transacted with
small expense to the fatherless.

Education was always esteemed a concern
of deepest interest, and there were common
schools from the first. Nor was it long before
a small college, such as the day of small things
permitted, began to be established ; and Yale
owes its birth “to ten worthy fathers, who, in
1700, assembled at Branford, and each one,
laying a few volumes on a table, said, ‘ I give
these books for the founding of a college, in
this colony.' ''

    
    
 
   
   
   
 
   
   
  
    
    
   

The power of a brutal soldiery was defiedss .
by whole companies of faithful men, that still
assembled to sing their psalms3 and from the,
country and the city, from the comfortable
homes of wealthy merchants, from the abodes
of an humbler peasantry, from the workshops'
of artisans‚ hundreds of thousands of men rose
up, as with one heart, to bear testimony to th'ov
indefeasible, irresistible right to freedom of
mind.

Every wise government was eager to offer a..
refuge to the upright men who would carry to*

tures, and the wealth of France. Emigrantt .
