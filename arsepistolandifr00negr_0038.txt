,20 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW.

vine Tragedy '' (1872); “Three Books of Song'' (1873); “The Hanging
of the Crane'' and “The Masque of Pandora·” (1875). A posthumous

drama, ‘'‘ Michael Angelo,'’ appeared in 1883.
As a poet Longfellow is characterized by tenderness and depth of

feeling, to the expression of which the picturesque and graceful simpli-
city of his language often imparts an inexpressible charm. He seldom
or never attempts to excite admiration by lofty flights and ambitious
metaphors, or by the exhibition of dark and terrible passions. He relied
chiefly for his success 011 his simple and direct appeal to those sentinients
which are common to all mankind—to persons of every rank and every
clime. It is perhaps not too much to say that he is not merely the first Α
but the only writer who has succeeded in giving a deep and living in-
terest to a story of Indian life. Notwithstanding the crudeness of the
materials which were laid to his hand, he yet produced a poem which not
only comes home to the hearts of the masses of the people but which ex-
cites the admiration of the public reader who takes into account the in·
herent qualities of the task. ,

Α good· deal of Longfellow‘s literary work consisted in translations
from the writings of foreign authors, in which he showed great aptitude,
so that while with ordinary translations the charm of the original is apt
to be marred or lost entirely, his translations preserved for the most part
all the original beauty, and in many instances even added to it.

THE OLD FARMHOUSE.

E sat within the farmhouse old And all that fills the hearts of friends,
&Vhose windows, lookiug 0'e1· the hay, When first they feel, with secret pain.
Gave to the sea-breem, (lamp and 00111, Their lives thenceforth have separate ends,
An easy entrance, night and day. And never can be one again3
Not far away we saw the port— The first slight swerving of the heart,
The strange, old-fashioned, silent town— That words are powerless to express,
The lighthouse—the dismantled fort-- And leave it still unsaid in part,
The wooden houses, quaint and brown. Or say it in too great exceflfl.
We sat and talked until the night, The very tones in which we spake
Descending, filled the little 1·00m; Had something strange, I could but mark;
0111· faces faded from the sight, The leaves of memory seemed to make
Our voices only broke the gloom. A mournfnl rustling in the dark.
We spake of many a vanished scene, Oft diedthe words upon our lips,
Of what we once had thought and said, As suddenly, from out the fire
Of what had been and might have been, Built of the wreck of stranded ships,

And who was changed, and who was dead ; ι The flames would leap and then expire.
