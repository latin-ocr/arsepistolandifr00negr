THEoDoRE RoosssvELT.

Author, Statesman and President of the United StateS.

 

{2- R. ROOSEVELT is the first President our country has had
i who held a conspicuous position in the ranks of authorship.
It may be said of him that he was gifted with the pen before
¹ l* he was mighty with the sword. His style is concise, free from
ornament, and he knows how to express his thoughts in terse,

vigorous English. He rightly assumes that straightforward‚
forceful expression is more effective that polished periods.

A man of great energy, physical vigor, and fond of outdoor life and
wholesome sports, he is a type of that sturdy manhood which is admired
by the young men of our country. Of good birth and culture, he is far
from being 311 aristocrat, and is as much at home with the rough cowboys
of our western plains as he is with statesmen and leaders of public
opinion. He evidently aims to adapt himself to every new situation and
emergency.

Mr. Roosevelt entered upon the responsible duties of President upon
the death of the martyred and lamented McKinley. Statesman, author,
ranchman and “rough ride1·,'‘ he was born in New York City, October
27, 18 58. Η6 was educated at Harvard, and afterward traveled in
Europe. Returning to America he was elected to the State Assembly at
Albauy, and was always active in legislation in which reform measures
were at stake. In 1884 M12Roosevelt purchased a ranch in Montana,
and spent much of his time among the cowboys of the West.

Four years later he was appointed member of the United States civil
service commission, resigning in 189 5 to become president of the New
York Board of Police Commissioners. In 1897 he became Assistant
Secretary of the Navy, and on the outbreak of the war with Spain helped
to organize (subsequently becoming the regiment's lieutenant-colonel) the

 

“ Rough Riders,'' composed of eracl< shots and fighters from both East
aud West. He led the regiment up San Juan Hill, at Santiago, July 1,
1898, and was soon afterward promoted to its colonelcy. On his return

to New York he was tendered the Republican nomination for Governor,
