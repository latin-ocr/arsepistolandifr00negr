And this was all the religion he had-—
To treat his engine well ;

Never be passed on the river ;
To mind the pilot's bell;

And if ever the “ Prairie Belle ’' took fire,
A thousand times he swore

He'd hold her nozzle agin the bank
Till the last soul got ashore.

All boats has their day on the Mississip'5
And her day came at last—
The Movastar was a better boat,
But the Belle, she wouldn’t be passed,
And so came tarin’ along that night,
The oldest craft on the line,
With a nigger squat on her safety-valve,
And her furnaces crammed, rosin and pine.

The fire bust out as she clared the bar,
And burnt a hole in the night,

And quick as a flash she turned, and made
For that willer-bank on the right.

THE RIVER.

GRANDLY flowing River!

O silver-gliding River!

Thy springing willows shiver
In the sunset as of old ;

They shiver in the silence

Of the willow-whitened islands,

While the sun-bars and the sand-bars
Fill air and wave with gold.

Ο gray, oblivious River!
O sunset-kindled River!
Do you remember ever
The eyes and skies 80 blue

Over all the infernal roar, [out
‘⁴ I’ll hold her nozzle agin the bank
Till the last galoot's ashore.''

Thro' the hot,black breath of the burnin' boat
J im Bludso's voice was heard,

And they all had trust in his cussednesS,
And know'd he would keep his word.

And sure's you’re born, they all got off
Afore the smoke stacks fell,

And Bludso's ghost went up alone
In the smoke of the “ Prairie Belle.''

He warn’t no saint—but at judgment
I'd run my chance with J im

’Longside of some picus gentlemen
That wouldn’t shook hands with him.

He’d seen his duty a dead sure thing,
And went for it thar and then;

And Christ ain't a-going to be too hard
On a man that died for men.

On a summer day that 8110110 here,

When we were all alone here,

And the blue eyes were too wise
To speak the love they knew?

O stern, impassive River!
O still unanswering River!
The shivering willows quiver

As the night-winds moan and rave.
From the past a voice is calling,
From heaven a star is falling,
And dew swells in the bluebellfl

Above the hillside grave.
