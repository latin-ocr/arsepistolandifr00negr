418 FAVORITE POEMS AND PROSE SELECTIONS.

I want the voice of honest praise
To follow me behind,

And to be thought, in future days,
The friend of human kind ;

That after-ages, as they rise,
Exulting may proclaim ;

In chora} uniou to the skies‚
Their blessings on my name,

These are the wants of morta] man ;
Ι cannot need them long,

For life itself is but a span,
And earthly bliss a song,

My last great want, absorbing all,
Is, when beneath the sod,

And summoned to my final call—-

The mercy of my God.

THE BIVOUAO OF· THE DEAD.
ΒΥ THEODORE o’HARA.

An American poet. born in Kentucky about 1820; served in the Mexican War3 was ἶ
Colonel in the Consederate army, and then chief of staff to Genera] Breckenridge. Died in ⁴

Alabama in 1867. The poem liere presented is a model of its kind and in some features is

without a rival.

HE muffled drum’s sad roll has beat
Τ The soldier's last tatt003
No more on life's parade shall meet
The brave and fallen few.
On F ame’s eternal camping-ground
Their silent tents are spread,

And glory guards with solemn round
The bivouac of the dead.

No rumor of the foe’s advance
Now swells upon the wind,
No troubled thought at midnight haunts
Of loved ones left behind ;
No vision of the morrow's strife
The warrior’s dream alarms,
No braying horn or screaming fife
At dawn shall call to arms.

Their shivered swords are red with rust,
Their plumed heads are bowed,
Their haughty baumer trailed iu dust
Is now their martial shroud—

And pleuteous funeral tears have washed ¹

The red stains from each brow,
And the proud forms by battle gashed
Are free from anguish now.

The neighing troop, the fiashing blade,
The bugle’s stirring blast,

The charge, the drcadful cannonade,
The din and shout are passed—

Nor war's wild note, nor glory's peal,
Shall thrill with fierce delight

Those breast< that never more may feel
The raptore of the fight.

 

Like the fierce northern hurricane
That sweeps his great plateau,

Flushed with the triumph yet to gain
Came down the serried foe-

tho heard the thunder of the fray
Break o'er the field beneath,

Knew well the watchward of that day
XVas victory or death.

Full many a mother's breath hath swept
O'er Angostura‘s plain,

And long the pitying sky has wept
Above its mouldered slain.

The raven's scream, or eagle's flight,
Or shepherd’s pensive lay,

Alone now wake each solemn height
T hat frowned o’er that dreaded fray.

. Sons of the Dark and Bloody Ground,

Ye must not slumber there,

, ὮῙ11010 stranger steps and tongues resound

Along the heedless air!

Your own proud land's heroic soil
Shall be your fitter grave:

She claims from war its richcst spoil--
The ashes of her brave.

Thus 'neath their parent turf they rest,
Far from the gory field,

Borne to a Spartan mother's breast
On many a bloody shield.

The sunshine of their native sky
Shines sadly on them here,

1 And kindred eyes and hearts watch by

The heroe's sepulchre.
