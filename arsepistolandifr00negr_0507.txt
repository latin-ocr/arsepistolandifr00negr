FAVORITE POEMS AND PROSE SELECTIONS.

And so we fished till the sun was high,
And the morning hours were all gono by,
And the village clock struck one.
“ I am hungry, Ji1n,” then dad would say;
“ Let’s give the fishes a chance to play
Until our 11111011 15 donc.”
Oh, nothing 1135 ever tastcd so sweet
As the big sandwiches I used to eat
WVhen I went fishing with dad.

Then dad and Ι would lay 011 the grass
And Wait for the heat of the (lay to pass ε
How happy Ι used to secl 1
And what wonderful stories he would tell
To 1110 cager lioy that 110 loved so well,
After our mid-day moal!
And how I would nestle close to his side
'l'o 11031· 111’ the world so big aud wide
'When Ι went fishing with dad.

For I cagerly listened to every word ;
And then among men of whom I heard
How I longed to play a part 1
What wonderful dreams of the future came,
1171131, visions of wealth and an honored name,
To fill my boyish beart !
There is no dream like the old dream,
There is no stream like the old stream
Where Ι went fishing with dad.

Then back again to our sport we'd go,
And fish till the sunset's crimson glow
Lit up the dying day;
Then 11311 would 0311 to me, “ Jim‚ we’ll
stop;
The basket is full to the very top ;
It’s time we were on our way.'’
There are no ways like the old ways,
There are no days like the old days
When I went fishing with dad.

Τ11011 wo took our way through the 1110311011-
land,
And Ι clung so tight to 1115 wrinkled hand,
As happy as I could 110.
And when the old house came in sight,
The smile on 1115 0111 face grew so bright
As he looked down at 1110.
And no 0110 51111105 as hc used to smile;
And, oh, it 5001115 siu-h a long, long while
Since Ι went lishiug with 11311.

It 15 ’way‚ 'way back 111 tho weary years
That with aching heart 31111 falling tears
I watchcd dud go away.
His aged head lay on my breast
11711011 the angds called him home to rest—-
He was too old to stay.
And Ι <lug a grave 'ncath the very sod
That my boyish feet so often trod
11711011 Ι went fishing with dad.

The world has given me wealth and fame,
Fulfilled my dreams of 311 honored name,
And now I am weak and 0]d;
The land 15 1111110 wherever I look ;
I can catch my fish with a silver hook ;
But my days are almost told
Uncheered by the love of child or wife,
Ι would spend the end of my lonely life
11711010 Ι went fishing with dad.

My limbs are weary‚ my eyes are dim ;

I shall tell them to lay me close by him,
Whenever Ι come to die ;

And side by side, it will be my wish,

That there by the stream where they used to

They will let the old men lie. [fish‚
Close by him I would like to be,
Buried beneath the old oak-tree,

11711010 Ι sat and fished with dad.

THE MOSQUITO HUNT.

The following parody is agood specimen of humor, the style of verse being suggested
by that well-known lyric, “ The Burial of Sir John Moore,” the first line of which is, “ N ot,

a drum was heard, not a funeral note.'’

OT a sound was heard but a terrible hum
Ν Α5 around the chamber we hurried,

In search of the mosquito whose trumpet
and drum
Our delectable slumber had worried.

We sought it darkly at de ad of night,
Our coverlet carefully turning,

By the struggling moonbeam’s mist y light,
And our candle dimly burning.
