man of daring thought, of subtle insight, had appeared, and it was like
the coming of a conqueror.

A number of New England T ranscendentalists began the publica—
tion of an organ in 1840, and to this Mr. Emerson became a contributor,
subsequently assuming the editorship which he held until 1844. During
this year a second volume of “Essays'' made its appearance. It was
characterized by the same striking peculiarities of thought and expression,
fully sustaining his previous reputation and greatly enlarging the circle
of his readers. Especially upon the young scholastic mind of the country
did he make a profound impression. By this time Mr. Emerson had
begun to think in verse, and although no one would have guessed he had
any poetica] gifts, he surprised the public by publishing a volume of

Of course, the judgment that readers form respecting Mr. Emerson’s
writings must depend very largely upon their own point of view, and
also largely upon their mental cultivation and powers of discernment.
To many he is like the title of one of his most renowned poems—the
Sphinx. They look at him without understanding him. They listen,
but he has no voice for them. He is dark, distant, cold, wanting in all
human elementS, and utterly incomprehensible. In short, a man to ’
understand Emerson must himself be an Emerson, just as it is true that
any one to appreciate a poet must himself possess, in some degree at least.

high intellectuality has gained so wide a circle of readers.

In 18 56 Mr. Emerson published “English Traits.'' It is one of his
