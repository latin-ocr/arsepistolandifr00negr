RICHARD HENRY DANA.

Fair ladies, fairer than all the spray
The prow is dashing wide,

Soft breezes take you on your way,
Soft flow the blessed tide.

0, might I like those breezes be,
And touch that arching brow,

I’d dwell forever on the sea
Where ye are floating now.

The boat goes tilting on the waves ;
The waves go tilting by;

There dips the duek— her back she laves :
O'erhead the sea-gulls fiy.

Now, like the gulls that dart for prey,
The little vessel stoops;

Now, rising, shoots along her way,
Like them, in easy swoops.

The sun falling 011 her sheet‚
It glitters like the drift ,
Sparkling, in scorn of summer's heat,
High up some mountain rift.

The winds are fresh3 she’s driving fast
Upon the bending tide 3

The orinkling sail, and orinkling mast,
Go with her side by side.

Why dies the breeze away so soon?
Why hangs the pennant down?

255

The sea is glass; the sun at noon—
Nay, lady do not frown ;

For, see, the winged fisher's plume
Is painted on the sea;

Below, a cheek of lovely bloom
Whose eyes look up to thee.

She smiles ; thou need’st must smile on her
And, see, beside her face

A rich, white cloud that doth not stir
What beauty, and what grace!

And pietured beach of yellow sand,
And peaked rook and hill,

Change the smooth sea to fairy-land ;
How lovely and how still 1

From that far isle the thresher's flail
Strikes close upon the ear :

The leaping fish, the swinging sail
Of yonder sloop‚ sound near.

The parting sun sends out a glow
Aoross the placid bay,

Touching with glory all the show—-
A breeze! Up helm 1 Away!

Careenin g to the wind, they mach,
With laugh and call, the shore.
They've left their footprints on the beaeh,
But them I hear no more.

 

THE: LITTLE BEAOH-BIRD.

HOU little bird, thou dweller by the sea,
Why takest thou its melancholy voice,
And with that boding cry
O'er the waves dost thou fly?

Oh! rather, bird, with me
- Through the fair land rejoioe!

The flitting form eomes ghostly dim and pale,
As driven by a beating storm at sea t
Thy cry is weak and scared,
As if thy mates had shared
The doom of us. Thy wail—
Whatdoes it bring to me?

Thou oallest along the sand, and hauntest the
y surge,
Restless and sad ; as if, in strange accord

 

With the motion and the roar
Of waves that drive to shore,
One spirit did ye urge—-
The Mystery-—the VVord.

Of thousands thou both sepulchre and pall,
Old ocean, art! A requiem o’er the dead
From out thy gloomy cells
A tale of mourning tells—
Tells of man’s woe and fall,
His sinless glory fied.

Then turn thee, little bird, and take thy flight
Where the complaining sea shall sadness
Thy spirit never more. [bring
Come, quit with me the shore
For gladness, and the light
VVhere birds of summer sing.
