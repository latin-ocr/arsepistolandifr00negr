RALPH WALDO EMERSON.

TO THE HUMBLE—BEE.

INE humble-bee! fine humble—bee'?

there thou art is 8111118 for 1118,
Let 1118111 sail for Porto Rique,

F 111-011ἱ heats through scas to 38811-

Ι will follow thee alone,

Thon animated torrid zone!

Zig-zag steerer, desert cheerer‚

1181 1118 8111138 thy waving lines,

Kcep me nearer, me thy hearer,

Siuging over shrubs and vines.

Flower-bells,
Honeyed cells—-
These the tents
Which he frequents,

Insect lover of the sun,

Joy of thy dominion!

Sailor of the atmosphere,
Swiminer through the waves of air,
Voyager of light and noon,
Epicurean of June,

Wait‚ I prithee‚ till I come

Within earshot of thy hum—

All without is murtyrdom.

XVhen the south wind in May days,

With a net of shining haze,

Silvers the horizon wall,

And with softness touching all,

Tints the human countenance Ι
With a color of romance, l
And infusing subtle heats ’ l
Tu rns the sod to violets— 1

Thon 111 suuny solitudes‚
Rover of the underwoods,

The green silence dost displace
With thy mellow breezy bass.

Hot midsummer's petted 810118,

Sweet to 1118 thy drowsy tune,

'selliug of countless sunny 1101113,

Long days, and solid ban ks of flowers,
Of gulfs of sweetness without bound
In Indian wilderness found,

Of Syriau peace, immortal leisure.

F irmest cheer, and bird-like pleasure.

Aught unsavory or unclean
Hath my 1113881 never seen,

But violets, and bilberry bells,
Maple sap, and daflbdels,
clover, catchfly, adder’s tongue,
And brier-roses dwelt among.
All beside was unknown waste,
All was picture as he passed.

VViser far than human 3881,
Yellow-breeched philosopher,
Seeing only what is fair,
Sipping only what 13 sweet
Thou dost mock at fate. ancl care,
Leave the chaff and take the wheat.
When the fierce north-wester hlast
Cools sea and land s'o far and fast—-
Thou already slumberest deep,
Woe and want thou canst outsleep;
lVant and woe which torture us,
Thy sleep makes ridiculous.

 

THE RHODORA.
LINEs ON BEING ASKED, WHENCE Is THE FLoWER‘.»

N May, when sea-windspierced our solitu'des,
Ι found the fresh Rhodora in the woods‚
Spreading its leafless blooms in a (lamp
To plealsgotlhb desert and the sluggish brook3
The purple petals fallen in the pool
Make the black waters with their beauty
Youngglssg'fihael might covet such a school;
The lively show beguiled 1118 from iny way. 1,

 

Rhodoral if the sage ask thee why
This charmis wasted on the marsh and sky,
Dear, tell them, that if eyes were made for

seeing,

¹ Then beauty is its own excuse for being.

Why, thou wert there, O, rival of the rose

' I never thought to ask, I never knew,

But in my simple ignorance suppose
The selfsame Power that brought me thore,

brought you.
