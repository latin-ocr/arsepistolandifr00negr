HOLY WILLIE’S PRAYER.

T HOU, wha in the heavens (lost (111611,

1111111, 113 it pleases best Thysel',

A’ fur Thy glory,
And no for onie guid or ill
They've done afore Thee!

Ι 111653 and praise Thy matehless might,
11711111] thousands Thou has left in night,
That Ι 11111 here afore Thy sight,

For gifts an’ grace,
A hurning an’ 11 shining light,

To 11’ this place.

11711111 was I, or my generation,

That Ι should get such exaltation?

I wha deservo such just dainnation,
For broken laws,

Five thousand years 'fore my creation,
Through Adam's cause.

11711611 frae my mither’s woinb I fell,
Thou might 11116 plunged me into hell,
To gnash my gums, to weep and wail,

In hurnin' lake,
11711616 (11111111611 devils roar and yell,

Chained to a stake.

Yet I am here a ehosen sample,

To show Thy grace is great and ample,

I'm here a pillar in Thy temple,
Strong as a roek,

A guide, a buekler, an example
To a' Thy floek.

O Lord, thou kens what zeal Ι bear,
Vthn drinkers drink and swearers swear,
And singing there, and ‹laneing here,

Wi' great and sma’ :
For I am keepit by Thy sear,

Free frae thern a’.

But yet, O Lord! confess Ι must,

At times I'm fashed wi' fleshly lust,

An’ sometimes, too, wi' wardly trust—-
Vile self gets in ;

1 But Thou remembers we are dust,

Defiled in sin.
