REGARD FOR THE NEGRO RAGE.

EXTRACT FROM A SPEECH ΟΝ THE RACE PROBLEM AT A BANQUET OF THE
BOSTON MERCHANTS' ASSOCIATION.

HE resolute, clear-headed, broad-minded
men of the South—the men whose genius
made glorious every page of the first

seventy years of American history—whose
cour-age and fortitude you tested in four years
of the fiercest war—realize, as you cannot,
what this race problem means—what they
owe to this kindly and dependent race. Nor
are they wholly to blame for the presence of
slavery. The slave-ships sailed from your
ports—the slaves once worked in your fields,
and you sold them to the South. Neither of
us now defends the traffic, nor the institution.

The love the whites of the South feel for
the negro race you cannot measure nor com-
prehend. As I attest it here, the spirit of my
old black mammy from her home up there
looks down to bless, and through the tumult
of this night steals the sweet music of her
croonings as thirty years ago she held me in
her black arms and led me smiling into sleep.
This scene vanishes as I speak, and I catch a
vision of an old Sonthern home, with its lofty
pillum, and its white pigeons fluttering down
through the golden air.

Ι see women with strained and anxious
faces and children alert yet helpless. I see
night come down with its dangers and its ap-
prehensions, and in a big homely 100111 Ι feel
on my tired head the touch of lovin g hands—
now worn and wrinkled, but fairer to me yet
than the hands of mortal woman, and stronger
yet to lead me than the hands of mortal man
-—as they lay a mother's blessing there while
at her knees-the truest altar I yet have found

-Ι thank God that she is safe in her sanctu· ζ
ary, because her slaves, sentinel in the silent
cabin or guard at her chamber door, puts a ⁴
black man's loyalty between her and danger. -

I catch another vision. The crisis of battle ’
-a soldier struck, staggering, fallen. I see a
slave, scuffling through the smoke, winding his
black arms about the fallen form, reckless of
the hurtling death—bending 1118 trusty faceto '
catch the words that tremble on the stricken
lips, so wrestling meantime with agony that
he would lay down his life in his master’s
stead. Ι see him by the weary bedsffle, min-
istering with uncomplaining patience, praying
with all his humble heart that God will list
his master up, until death comes in mercy and
in honor to still the soldier's agony and seal
the soldier’s life.

Ι see him by the open grave, mute, motion-
less, uncovered, suffering for the death of him
who in life fought against 1118 freedom· I see
him when the mound is heaped and the great
drama of his life is closed, turn away and with
downcast eyes and uncertain step start out
into new and strange fields, faltering, strug-
gling, but moving on, until his shambling·
figure is lost in the light of this better and
brighter day. And from the grave comes a
voice saying, “ Follow him! Put your arms
about him in his need, even as he put his
about me. Be his friend as he was mine.’'
And out into this new world—strange to me as
to him, dazzhng, bewildering both-I follow!
And may God forget my people—when they
forget these.
