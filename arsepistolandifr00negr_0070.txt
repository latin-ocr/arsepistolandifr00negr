48 RALPH WALDO EMERSON.

1849, containing a selection from his lecturcs and addresses, including
the famous essay on “ Nature,” and other essays entitled, “ The Conduct
of Life,'' “ Society and Solitude,'' and “ Letters and Social Aims.'' In all
of his writings Mr. Emersou shows a very high order of mind, a strong
epigrammatic style, and illustrates the saying of Richelieu that the “ pen
is mightier than the sword.‘’ He is “ a seeker with no Past at his back‚''

but “ acts 111 1116 living Present : ''

Shines tho last age, the next with hope is seen,
'ro-‹lay slinks poorly off unmarked between ;
Futura m· Past no richer secret folds,

O sriendless Prosent! than thy bosom holds.

He evidently aims to break the moulds of popular beliefs, and to get
at the heart of the matter, to look around and within with the fresh vision
of “a first man,'' and like Adam 111 1116 garden to put his own names
upon what he sees. He has none of the ill humor which denies because
others affirm3 he simply takes leave to look for himself. While there-
fore he continually sees and represents things in singular lights, and
sometimes inverts them, so that it would seem to be an inevitable conclu-
sion that either he is crazy or we, on the other hand he regenerates our
saith, by giving us 311 original testimony to great truths. Thus, his
essay on “ The Over-Soul '' is 35 orthodox as St. Paul.

Whatever appearances there may be to the contrary, Mr. Emerson is
never destructive. He is 3 builder, a born and anointed poet. His
demand is Truth. He must stand face to face with it. Insatiable as is
his craving for truth, he is always orderly and serene. He gives no sign
that any deterring considerations have ever occurred to him. Whatever
suggestions of sear or policy there may be, they are less than cobwebs to

him.
Mr. Emerson 15 never commonplace. Hence we infer that he was 3

genuine worker. Every thing is wrought out by his own thought. Hc
must, in his 11511655 moments, have repined 31 1116 stubbornness of his gen-
ius, which could bear to be mute, but could not declaim, nor tolerate 111
him any attempt at “ fine writing.’' There is a very common talent, pass-
ing for a great deal more than it is worth—the sole talent of many quite
distinguished writers—which lies in the putting of words together so fitly
and musically that they seem to sing a new truth‚ when it is “ 311 old song‚''
with 110 variations. Mr. Emerson is utterly deficient in this power. He

was sublimely original.
