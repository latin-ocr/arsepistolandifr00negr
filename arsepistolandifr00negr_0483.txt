FAVORITE POEMS AND PROSE SELECTIONS. 435

Once more on the deck I stand, The land is no longer in view,

Of my own swift-gliding craft ι The clouds have begun to frown ;
Set sail! farewell to the land ; But with a stout vessel and crew,

The gale follows fair abaft. We’ll say, Let the storm come down 1
We shoot through the sparkling foam, And the song of our heart shall be,

Like an ocean-bird set free— While the winds and the waters rave,
Like an ocean-bird, our home A home on the rolling sea l

We’ll find far out on the sea. A life on the ocean wavel

HE Frost looked forth, one still clear night, He went to the windows of those who slept,
And he said, “ Now I shall be out ofsight3 And over each pane like a fairy crept ;
So through the valley and over the height NVherever he breathed, wherever he stepped,

In silence I’ll take my way, By the light of the moon were seen
I will not go like that blustering train, Most beautiful things. There were flowers
The wind and the snow, the hail and the rain, and trees,
Who make so much bustle and noise in vain3 There were bevies of birds and swarms of bees,
But I’ll be as busy as they ! '' There were cities, thrones, temples and towers,

and these
Then he went to the mountain, and powelered All pictured in Silver sheen l
its orest,

He climbed up the trees, and their boughs he But he (lid one thing that was hardly fair—-
dressed He peeped in the cupboard, and finding there

With diamonds and pearls‚ and over the breast That all had forgotten for him to prepare-—
Of the quivering lake he spread “Now just to set them a-thinking‚

A coat of mail, that it need not sear I'll bite this basket of f1·uit‚'' said he ;

The downward point of many a spear “ This costly pitcher I'll burst in three,

That he hung on its margin, far and near, And the glass of water they've left for me
Where a rock could rear its head. Shall ‘ tchick ' to tell them I’m drinking.'’
