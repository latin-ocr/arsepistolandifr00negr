charge in Boston. Early in his life he became known as a

 

vigorous, attractive writer and lecturer. He made choice of
subjects of an educational character, his aim being not only to please and
entertain, but to instruct his readers and hearers.

His aim in all his writings is well expressed by a motto in one of
his most popular books, “Ten Times One 15 Ten,'' in which he says, “ Look
up and not down 1 Look forward and not backward 1 Look out and not
in! Lend a hand! ’'

Times One Is Ten,'' 1870; “Philip Nolan's Friends,'' 1876.

long career he has written for many periodicals, some of which are 110
