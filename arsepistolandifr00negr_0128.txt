00· JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER.

It touched the tangled golden curls,
And brown eyes, full of grieving‚

Of one who still her steps delayed
then all the school were leaving.

For near her stood the little boy,
Her childish favor singled,
His cap pulled low upon a face
Where pride and shame were mingled.

Pushing with restless feet the snow
To right and left, he lingered ;
As restlessly her tiny hands
The blue-ohecked apron fingered.

He saw her list her eyes; he felt
The soft hands' light caressing,

And heard the trembling of her voice,
As if a fault confessing:

“ I’m sorry that I spelt the word ;
I hate to go above you,

Because ’'——the brown eyes lower fell—
“ Because, you see, Ι love you 1 ’'

Still memory to a gray-balred man
That sweet child face is showing.

Dear girl! the grasses on her grave
Have forty years reen growing.

He lives to learn in life’s hard school,
How few who pass above him

Lament their triumph and his loss,
Like her—because they love him.

 

THE PUMPKIN.

FRUIT loved by boyhood! the old
days recalling;
WVhen wood-grapes were purpling and
brown nuts were falling!
XVhen wild, ugly faces were carved in ils skin,
Glaring out through the dark with a candle
. . v
NVhen getllaeffighed round the corn-heap‚ with
hearts all in tune,
Our chair a broad pumpkin, our lantern the
'Pellingmtzsljels' of the fairy who traveled like
In a phtggkin-shcll coach, with two rats for
her team!
Then thanks for thy presentl——none sweeter

or better

E'er smoked from an oven or circled a platterl
Fairer Eands never wrought at a pastry more
ne

Brighter eyes never watched o’er its baking,
than thine ; ’

And the prayer, which my mouth is too full
to express,

Swells my heart that thy shadow may never

s

That tgglliegy's of thy lot may be lengthened

And thlssfgwga’e of thy worth like a pumpkin-
vlne grow‚

And thy life be as sweet, and its last sunsei: v

Goldenffllited and fair as thy own pumpkin-
pie 1

 

MAUD MULLER.

MAUD Muller, on a summer's day,
Raked the meadow sweet with hay.

Beneath her torn hat glowed the wealth
Of simple beauty and rustic health.

Singing, she wrought‚ and her merry glee
The mock-bird echoed from his tree.

But, when she glanced to the far-off town,
White from its hill—slope looking down,

The sweet song died, and a vague unrest
And a nameless longing filled her breast—

A wish, that she hardly dared to own,
For something better than she had k‘nown

The J udge rode slowly down the lane,
Smoothing his horse's chestnut mane.

He drew his bridle in the shade
Of the apple-trees, to greet the maid,
