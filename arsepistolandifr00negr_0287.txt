GEORGE HENRY BOKER. 239

Then I remembered little more; I tried to speak. He understood
One look to heaven Ι gave, The wish I could not speak.

there, like an angel's wing‚ I saw He turned me. There, thank Godz the flag
Οιιῑ1 spotless ensigu wave. Still fluttered at the peak!

I tried to eheer. I cannot say And there, while thread shall hang to thread
VVhether Ι swam or sank3 Oh, let that ensign fly!

A blue mist closed around my eyeS‚ The noblest constellation set
And everything was blank. Against the northern sky—

When Ι awoke, a soldier lad, A sign that we who live may claim
All dripping from the sea, The peerage of the brave ;

With two great tears upon his eheeks‚ A monument that needs no scroll‚
Was bending over me. For those beneath the wave-

 

DIRGE FOR A SOLDIER.
MAJoR-GENERAL PHILIP KEARNEY, KILLED AT CHANTILLY, VA., SEPT. 1, 1862.

LOSE his eyes; work is done! Fold him ln his country' s stars,
What to him is friend or foeman, Roll the drum and fire the volley!
Rise of moon or set of sun² What to him are all our wars ?
Hand of man or kiss of woman? What but death· b-emooking folly!
Lay him low, lay him low, Lay him low, lay him low,
In the clover or the snow l In the clover or the snow!
What cares he? he cannot know; What cares hel he cannot know;
Lay him low 1 Lay him low l
As man may, he fought his fight, Leave him to God's watehing eye ;
Proved his truth by his endeavor; Trust him to the hand that made him,
Let him sleep in solemn night, Mortal love weeps idly by :
Sleep fol-ever and forever. God alone has power to aid him.
Lay him low, lay him low, Lay him low, lay him low,
In the clover or the snow 1 In the clover or the snow !
What care he? he cannot know3 ’ What cares he! he cannot know ;

Lay him low! Lay him low 1
