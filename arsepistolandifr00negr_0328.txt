leaving him to the guardian care of his grandmother. When
not more than nine or ten years old he began to write verses 3
at fifteen he was a contributor to the poetical department of
journals printed near his home3 and at eighteen he published his first
volume, entited “ Lyrical and Other Poems‚'' which was followed by other
works, all showing more than ordinary ability.

W'hen twenty-one years old, Mr. Simms was admitted to the bar and
began to practice his profession in his native district, but feeling a deep
interest in the political questions which then agitated the country, hc
soon abandoned the courts and purchased a daily Gazette at Charleston,
which he edited for several years with industry, integrity and ability.
He was not altogether successful in journalism and resolved to retrieve
his fortunes by authorship. His principal poetical work, “Atlantis, a
Story of the Sea,” was published in New York in 1833.

Soon after the appearance of “ Atlantis,’‘ Mr. Simms published
in the “American Quarterly,'' a review of Mrs. Trollope's “Domestic
Manners of the Americans,'' which was reprinted, in several editions, in
this country and in England3 and in 1833 appeared his first romance,
“Martin Faber, the Story of a Criminal,’' parts of which had been
printed several years before in a magazine conducted by him in Charles-
ton. In the same year he published “The Book of My Lady,’' and, in,
the summer of 1834, “ Guy Rivers‚ a Tale of Georgia,’' which was fol-
lowed by “The Yemassee‚'' “The Partisan,'' “ Mellichampe‚’' “ Pelayo,''
“ Carl VVernerss' “ The Damsel of Darien‚'' “ The Kinsman,” “The His-
tory of South Carolina,'' “The Blind Heart,'' and numerous sketcheS,
reviews, and miscellanies, in the periodicals.

Several other works have been generally attributed to him; though

the amount of his acknowledged writing seems to be as great as one man
