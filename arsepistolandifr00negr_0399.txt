linked it might be to those crumbling walls—
it might be to far different 5061165.

“ But never,'’ whispered Beatrice again, as
she softly swung open the gate, “never to be
passed at your side, or beneath your feet,
Marston Brent—never—-never 1 ”

She murmured the words again and again,
the bitter refrain of a dreary song, as she
lingered up the narrow path whose box-bor-
ders, brushed by her garments, gave out a
faint, melancholy perfume, a perfume of night
and autumn, of dead memories and hopes, and
life slowly lapsing into death, and then (1660)ν
and nothingness.

Fine ladies have their fancies, and in after
years it was noted as one of Miss VVansted’s
whims to detest the sight or smel] of box-
plants.

N ear the door she paused, and stood look-
ing in at the unshuttered window with the
same half-loathing interest that had held her
at the garden-gate.

She saw a room low aud large, its ceiling
divided by two heavy beams crossing each
other in the centre. Other beams stood sentry
in the corners, and rau like a low bench
around the side of the room. To one of these
a descendant of Peleg Barstow, crazed through
religious fanaticism, had been chained by his
family, and then had dragged out the twenty
weary years lying between such strange 1111-
prisonment and death„ The scar worn by his
chain still stared from the heavy bearn—a
character, and a significant one, in the hiero-
glyphic history unconsciously left behind by
the successive occupants of the Old Gan-ison.

At one end of the room yawned a fireplace
so wide that the bright copper andirons, with
their load of three-foot maple legs, were quite
at one end of it, while at the other end and
111 the back of the chimney was the door of a
‚great brick oven, and below it a bench where

Beatrice, a little rebellious imp, had often
been set to recover from the effects of too long
a ramble in the winter woods, 01· an involun-
tary immersion in the icy waters of the brock.

In one of the deep recesses of the windows
lay an enormous torloise-shell cat, her fore-
paws curled under her breast, her yellow eyes
half closed, and winking slowly at the fire.
Beyond her 111 the corner stood a clock, reach-
ing from floor to ceiling, sedate and grave, in
spite of the glittering brass ornaments which
it wore as meekly as an old lady wears the
=gold beads she retains from habit, although
the vanities of youth have long been laid aside.

Above the high mantle-shelf was fastened
the head and branching antlers of a decr, and
as the firelight rose and fell, its shadow‚ chang-
ing in every fantastic fashion, danced upon
the ceiling—now spreading to its farthest
limit, in semblance of a tangled arabesque,
now shrinking to such narrow limitis and so
defined a shape that it might have been the
ghost of the murdered stag peering down into
the room and demandiug restitution of his
stolen 11011015,

All alone in his deep arm-chan, before the
fire, sat an old man—a man so old that his
hair, long and thick and soft, had not one
dark thread left in its creamy masses ; that his
sace was not lined, but grained with wrinkles3
that his toothless jaws met in a straight, deep
line, hiding in great measure the expression
of the mouth3 and his form was bowed aud
trembling, even as 116 sat motionless before
the fire. His eyes shrewd and kindly, even

through the dimness of age, were fixed upon
the blaze, and his white and shapely hands
were folded meditatively upon his knee. A
charming picture of serene old age, but Bea-
trice regarded it with a shiver.

‘⁴ Ninety-four years old 1 '' murmured she
“ and I but twenty. If Ι should live till then! ''
