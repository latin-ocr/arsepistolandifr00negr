FRANCES MIRIAM WHITCHER.

(That's as true as the Scripturs; I never Crosby hadent no inclination‚ and so it all

knowed him to say a harsh word.)

I never changed my single lot—
I thought 'twould be a sin——

(Though widder Jinkins says it's because Ι
never had a chance.) Now 'tain’t forme 10
say whether Ι ever hud a numerous number
0' chauces or not, but there's them livin' that
miqht tell if they wos a mind to; why, this
poitry was writ on account of being joked
about Major Goon, three years after husband
died. Ι guess the ginerality o' folks knows
what was the nature o' Major Coon’s fcelin's
towards me, tho' his wife and Miss ι1111111115
does say I tried to ketch him. The fact is,
Miss Coon feels wonderfully cut up 'cause she
knows the Major took her “ Jack at a pinch '²
—seein' he couldent get such as he wanted,
he took such as 116 60111(1 get—but Ι goes on
to say—-

Ι never changed my single lot,
I thought 'twould be a sin——

For I thought so much o' Deacon Bedott‚
I never got married agin,

If ever a hasty word he spoke‚
His anger dident last,

But vanished like tobacker smoke
Afore the wintry blast.

And since it was my lot to be
The wife of such a. man,

Tell the men that’s after me
To ketch me if they can.

If I was sick a single jot,
He called the doctor in—

That’s a fact—he used 10 be scairt to death if
anything ailed me. Now only jest think—-
widder Jinkins told Sam Pendergrasses wife
(she 'twas Sally Smith) that she guessed the
deacon dident set 110 great store by me, or he
wouldent a went off to confrence meetin'
when I was down with the sever. The truth
is, they couldent git along without him no way.
Parson Pottcr seldom went to confrence meetin,
and when he wa’n't there, who was ther' pray
tell, that knowed enough to take the lead if
husband dident do it?

Deacon Kenipe hadent no gift, and Deacon

come 111110 Deacon Bedott—and he was always
ready and willin' to do his duty, you know3
as long as he was able to stand on his legs he
continued to go 10 confrence meetin'3 why,
I've knowcd that man to go when he couldent
scarcely crawl on account 0’ the pain in the
spine of his back.

He had a wonderful gift, and he wa’n’t a
man 10 keep his talcnts hid up in a napkin—
so you see 'twas from a sense o' duty he went
when 1 was sick, whatever Miss J inkins may
say 10 1116 contrary. But where was I? Oh!—

If Ι was sick a singlejot,
He called the doctor in—

1 sot so much store by Deacon Bedott
I never got married agin.

A wonderful tender heart he had,
That felt for all mankind—

It made him feel amazin' bad
To see the world so blind.

NVhiskey and rum he tasted 1101-

That's as true as the Scripturs‚—but if you’ll
believe it, Betsy‚ Ann Kenipe told my Melissy
that Miss J inkins said one day to their house,
how't she'd 56611 Deacon Bedott high, time
and agin! did you ever! Well‚ I’m glad no-
body don’t pretend to mind anything she says.
I've knowed Poll Bingham from a gal, and
she never knowed how to speak the truth—
bcside she always had a pertikkeler spite
against husband and me, and between us tew
I'll tell you why if you won't mention it, for I
make it a pint never to say nothin' to injure
nobody.

well, she was a ravin'-distracted after my
husband herself, butit’s a long story, I'll tell
you about it some other time, and then you’ll
know why widder J inkins is eternally runnin’

1116 down. See—where had I got to? Oh, I
remember now—

Whiskey and rum he tasted not-—
He thought it was a sin—

Ι thought 50 11111611 o' Deacon Bedott
I never got married agin.

But now he's dead! the thought is killin’,
My grief I can't control—

He never left a single shillin’
His widder to console.
