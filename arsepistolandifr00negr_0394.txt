THE WAR· INEVITABLE.

r* *HEY tell us, sir, that we are weak,—

adversary. But when shall we bc

next year? Will it be when we are totally
(lisarinc‹l‚ and when a British guard shall be
stationed in every house? Shall we gather
strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall

by lying supinely on our backs, and hugging
the delus-ive phantom of hope, until our ene-

Sir, we are not weak‚ if we make a proper
use of those means which the God of nature

which our enemy can send against us. Be-

It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter.
Gentlemen may cry, peace, peace l—but there

next gale that sweeps from the North will

Those vast riches which cover the face of
your soil, as well as those which lie hid in
its bosom, are to be developed and gathered.
Your timber, sir, must be worked up into
ships, to transport the productioris of the soil
