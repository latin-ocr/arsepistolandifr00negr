Α1111 111611 1113 eyes vgrew very dim, and his
throat began to swell,

And in a 1103136, changed voice he spake,
“ FarewelL sweet child, farewell!

LORD MACAULAY.

And in another moment break forth from 1116
31111 311

A cry as if the Volscians were coming o'cr
the wall;

The house that was the happiest within the Till, with white lips and bloodshot eyes, Vir-

Roman walls—

The house that envied not the wealth of
Capua's marble halls,

Now, for the brightness of thy smile must
have 61611131 gloom‚

And for the music of thy voice, the silence
of the tomb.

“The time is come. The tyrant points his
eager hand this way;

See how his eyes gloat on thy grief, like a
kite’s upon the prey;

With all his wit he little deems that, spurned‚
betrayed, bereft,

Thy father 113111 111 1113 despair, one fearful
refuge left;

He little deems that in this hand, I clutch
what still can save

Thy gentle youth from taunts and blows‚ the
portion of the slave;

Yea, and from nameless evil. that passeth
taunt and 111011-

Foul outrage, which thou knowest not—which
thou shalt never know.

Then clasp me round the neck once more, and
give me one more kiss;

And now, mine own dear little girl, there is
no way but this! ‘'

With that, he lifted high the steel, and smote
her in the side,

And in her blood she sank to earth, and with
one 301) 3116 died.

Then, for a little moment, all people held
their breath ;

And through the crowded Forum was still-
ness as of death .

ginius tottered nigh,
And stood before the judgment seat, and held
the knife on high t

“ O dwellers 111 1116 nether gloom‚ avengers of ¹

the slain,

By this dear blood I cry to you, do right
between us twain ;

And e’en 33 Appius Claudius hath dealt by
me and mine,

Deal you by Appius Claudius and all the
Claudian line! ''

So spake the slayer of his child, and turned,
and went his way;

But first he cast one haggard glance to where
the body lay,

And writhed, and groaned a fearful groan,
and 111611, with steadfast feet,

Strode right across the market-place unto the
Sacred street.

Then up sprang Appius Claudius: “Stop
him, alive or dead!

Ten thousand pounds of copper to the man
who brings his head! ’'

He looked upon 1113 clients—but none would
work his will ;

He looked upon his lictors——but they trem-
bled and stood still.

And as Virginius through the press his way
in silence cleft,

Ever the mighty multitude fell back to right
and left ;

And he 113111 passed in safety unto his woeful
home,

And there taken horse to tell the camp what
deeds are done in Rome.
