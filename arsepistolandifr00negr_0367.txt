WILLIAM WIRT. 319

In 1808 he was elected to represent the city of Richmond in the
House of Delegates‚ and he acquired new distinction by his labors in that
body3 but though often invited to do so he would never after leave the
path of his profession. He wrote, indeed, in support of Mr. Jefferson’s
administration, and in favor of the nomination of Mr. Madison for the
Presidency3 but except when influenced by private friendship he had as

little as possible to do with party politics.
Mr. Wirt was appointed by President Madison in 1816 Attorney for

the district of Virginia, and on the election of Μ1.ΜΟ11100 to the Presidency‚
in the following year, he was made Attorney General of the United States.
He now removed to W'ashingtom where he resided until 1830, when, at
the close of the administration of Mr. Asianis, he resigned his office, and
took up his residence in Baltimore, where he passed the remainder of his
life. He died on the eighteenth of February, 1834, in the sixty-second

year of his age.

Mr. Wirt's literary writings are a “ Life of Patrick Henry;''
“ Eulogy on the Lives and Characters of Adams and Jefferson 3 ” A Dis-
course before the Societies of Rutgers’ CoHege, in 18 303 and 31] AddseSS
delivered in Baltimore. in the same year, on the “Triumph of Liberty

in France.''

WHO IS BLANNERHASSETT?
FROM A SPEECH AT THE TRIAL OF AARoN BURR.

ΗΟ 15 Blannerhassett? A native of
Ireland, a man of letters, who fied
from the storms of his own country

to find quiet in ours. His history shows that
war is not the natural element of his mind.
If it had been, he never would have ex-
changed Ireland for America. So far is an
army from furnishing the society natural and
proper to Mr. Blannerhassett's character, that
on his arrival in Ameriea he retired even
from the population of the Atlantic States,
and sought quiet and solitude in the bosom of
our western forests.

But he carried with him taste, and science,
and wealth ; and lo, the desert smiled! Pos-
sessing himself of a beautiful island in the
Ohio, he rears upon it a palme, and decorates
it with every romantio embellishment of
fancy. A shrubbery, that Shenstone might
have envied‚ blooms around him. Music,

that might have charmed Calypso and her
nymphs, is his. An extensive libi-ary spreads
its treasures before him. A philosophical ap-
paratus offers to him all the secret mysteries
of nature. Peace, tranquillity, and innocence
shed their iningled delights around him. And
to crown the enchantment of the scene, awffe,
who is said to 110 lovely even beyond her sex,
and graced with every accomplishment that
can render it irresistible, had blessed him
with her love and made him the father of
several children.

The evidence would convince you that this
is but a faint picture of the real life. In the
midst of 311 this peace, this innocent sim-
plicity‚ and this tranquillity, this feast of the
mind, this pure banquet of the heart, the de·
stroyer comes ; he comes to change this para-
dise into hell. Yet the flowers do not wither
at his approach. No monitory shuddering
