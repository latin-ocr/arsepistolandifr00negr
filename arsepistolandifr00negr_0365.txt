LUCY LARCOM. 317

Sometimes they seem like living 61111966-
The people of the sky—
Guests in white raiment coming down
From Heaven, which is close by ‘:
Ι 61111 them by familiar names,
As one by one draws nigh,
So white, so light, so spirit-like,
From violet niists they bloom 1
The aching wastes of the unknown
Are half reclaimed from gloom,
Since 011 life's hospitable sea
All souls find sailing-room.

Here sit I, as a little child ε
The threshold of God's door

Is that clear band of chrysoprase ‚
Now the vast temple fioor,

The binding glory of the dome
Ι bow my head before :

The universe, O God, is home,
In height or depth 10 1116 ;

Yet here upon thy footstool green
Content am I to be;

Glad when is opencd to my 116611
Some sea-like glimpse of thee.

 

-HANNAH BINDING SHOES.

OOR lone Hannah,
sitting at the window binding shoes,
F 1111611, wrinkled,

Sitting, stitching in 11 mournful muse,
Bright-eyed beauty once was she,
then the bloom was 011 the tree;

Spring and winter
Hannah’s at the window binding 611066.

Not 11 neighbor
Passing nod 01· answer will refuse
To her whisper,
“ Is there from the fishcrs any news ? ’'
Oh her heart's adrift with one
On an endlcss voyage gone!
N ight and morning
Hannah's at the window binding shnes.

Fair young Hannah
Ben, the sunburnt fisher, gaily woos ;
Hale and elever,
For a willing heart and hand he sues.
May-day skies are all aglons,
And the waves are laughing so!
For her wedding
Hannah leaves her window and her shoes.

May is passing ;
Mid the apple-boughs a pigeon cooes.
Hannah shudders,

For the 1111111 southwester mis-chief brvws,

Round the rocks of Marblehead,
Outward bound a schooner sped ;
silent, lonesonie,
Hannah's at the window binding 611066.

’ Tis November :
Now 110 tear her wasted 611161( 1)611611’6;
From Ncwfoundland,

Not 11 61111 retur-ning will 6110 1066.
11Ῑ1116Ρ61111ἕ hoarsely,“ Fisherinen,
Have you, have you heard of Ben‘?''

Old with watehing,
Hannah's at the window binding 611066.

Twenty winters
Bleach 111111 tear the ragged 611016 6116 views;
T wenty 661160116-
Never one has brought her any news.
Still her dim eyes silently
Chase the white 611116 0’61 the scas:
Hopeless‚ faithless‚
Hannah's at the window, binding shoes.
