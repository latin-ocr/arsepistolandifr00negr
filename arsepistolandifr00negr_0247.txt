JOHN BA RTHOLOMEW GOUGH.

“Danger! Here, see the smoke bursting
puti—go fmward, if you would save your

ives!'’

Passengers and cmxv—men, women, and
children—crowded the forward part of the
ship. John Maynard stood at the helin. The
flames burst forth in a sheet of fire3 clouds of
smoke arose.

The captain eried out through his trumpet,
“John Maynard ! ''

“Ay, ay, sir ! '’

“Are you at the helm? ''

“Ay, ay, sir!''

‘⁴ How does she head ἶ) ”

“ South-east by east, sir.”

“ Head her south-east, and run her on

199

shore,” said the captain. Nearer‚ nearer, yet
nearer, she approaehed the shore. Again the
captain eried out, “ John Maynard ! ''

The response came feebly this time, “Ay, ay,
sir! ''

“ Can you hold on five minutes longer,
John? '' he said.

“ By God‘s help, I will! '’

The old man's hair was seorched from the
sealp; one hand was disabled 3—-his knee
upon the stanchion, his teeth set, his other
hand upon the wheeL he stood firm as a rock-
He beaehed the ship; everi· man, woman and
child was saved, as John Maynard dropped,
and his spirit took its flight to God.

 

THE POWER OF HABIT.

REMEMBER once riding from Buffalo to the land. Then on, boys; don't be alarmed,
Ι to the Niagara F alls. I said to a gen- there is no danger.’'

tleman, ‘⁴ What river is that, sir?⁷’

“ That‚'’ said he, “is Niagara River,''

“Well‚ it is a beautiful stream,’' said I;
“ bright and fair and glassy. How far off are
the rapids?''

“ Only a mile or two,'' was the reply.

“ Is it possible that only a mile from us we
shall find the water in the turbulenee which
it must show near the Falls ⁶? ’'

“You will find it so, sir.'' And so I found
it; and the first sight of N iagara Ι shall never
forget.

Now, launeh your bark on that Niagara
River; it is bright, smooth‚ beautiful and
glassy. There is a ripple at the bow; the
silver wake you leave behind adds to your
enjoyment. Down the stream you glide, oars,
sails, and helm in proper trim, and you set
out on your pleasure excursion.

Suddenly some one eries out from the bank,
“ Young men, ahoy ! ''

“ What is it? '’

“The rapids are below you 1 ”

“Hal ha! we have heard of the rapids;
but we are not such fools as to get there. If
we go too fast, then we shall up with the

“ Young men, ahoy, there! ''

“What is it ?''

‘⁴ The rapids are below you ? ’'

“Ha! ha! we will laugh and quaff3 all
things delight us. What care we for the
future? No man ever saw it. Sufficient for
the day is the evil thereos. W⁷e will enjoy
life while we may, will catch pleasure as it
flies. This is enjoyment; time enough to
steer out of danger when we are sailing
swiftly with the eurrent.'’

“ Young men, ahoy ! '¹

“ What is it? ''

“ Beware! beware!
you!''

“ Now you see the water foamin g all around,
See how fast you pass that point! Up with
the helm! Now turn! Pull hard! Quiek!
quick! quick! pull for your lives! pull till
the blood starts from your nostrils, and the
veins stand like whip cords upon your brow!
Set the mast in the socket! hoist the sail!
Ah! ahl it is too late! Shrieking, blas-
pheming, over they g0.''

Thousands go over the rapids of intemper-
anee every year, through the power of habit,

The rapids are below

helm, and steer to the shore3 we will set the (ῆν-14113311 tho while, “YVhen I find out that
mast in the soeket‚ hoist the sail, aud speed 1 it is injuring me, l will give it up!''
