The diamond, topaz, amethyst, To rate her charms, I’d call them heaven;
The emerald mild, the ruby gay ; For though a mortal made of clay,
Talk of my gem, Anne Hathaway! Angels must love Anne Hathaway ;

Their various lustros to desz— To rapture, the imprisoned soul,
The jewels she, and the foi! they, And sweetest heaven on earth display,

She hath a way, She hath a way,
Anne 1161116116)ν ; Anne Hathaway;
