THOMAS CAMPBELL.

With folded arms N apoleon stood,
Serene alike in peace and danger:

And in his wonted attitude,
Addressed the stranger :—

“ Rash man that wouldst yon 0110111101 pass
On twigs and staves so rudely fashioned ;

Thy heart with some sweet British lass
Must be impassioned.”

“ Ι 110νο 110 swectheart‚'' said the lad ;

‘⁴ But—absent long from one another-
Great was the longing that I had

To see my mother.''

“ And so thou shalt‚” N apoleon said,

So brave 0 0011.

Ηο gave the tar a piece of gold,
And with a flag of truce commanded
He should be shipped to England Old,
And safely lauded.

Our sailor oft could scantly shift
To find a (11111101 plain and hearty;
But never changed the coin and gift

EXILE OF ERIN.

HERE came to the beach a poor Exile

The dew on his thin robe was heavy and

For his country he sighed when at twilight

To wander alone by the wind-beaten hill.
But the day-star attracted his eye's sad de-

For it rose o'er his own native 1010 of the ocean.
Where 01100, 111 1110 fire of his youthful emotion,
He sang the bold anthem of Erin go bragh 1

“ Sad is my fate 1 '' said the heart-broken

But I have no refuge from famine and danger,

Never again in the green sunny bowers

Or cover my harp with the wild-woven flowers
And strike to the numbers of Erin go

But alas! in a fair foreign land I awaken,
And sigh for the friends who 0011 111001 1110 110

O cruel fate! wilt thou never replace me

Never again shall my brothers embrace mc?

They died to defend me, or lived to d -
