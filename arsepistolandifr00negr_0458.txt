DISGOVERY OF NEW YORK.

BOUT this time 3 solitary horseman
Α might have been seen at lVest Txvo
Hundred and Ninth street, clothed in
3 little brief authority, and looking out to
the west 35 116 petulantly spoke in the Tam-
many dialect. As he stands there aboard of
1115 111 ›rse 0116 5665 that he is 3 chief in every
res pect, 31111 111 lifc’s gieat drama would
naturally occupy the middle of the stage. It
xxas at this moment that Huds 5011 slipped
down the river froin Albany past Fort Lee,
and, droppiug 3 nickle in the slot at One
Hundred and Twenty-fifth street, weighed his
anchor at that place. As soon 35 116 had
lauded and discovered the city, he was ap-
proached by the chief, who said: “ We gates.
l am 011 the coininittee to show you our little
town. I suppose you have a power of attorney,
of course, for discovering us? '²

“ Yes,'’ said Hudson.

“ Very good‚'' said the chief, 35 they jogged
down-town 011 3 Sixth Avenue elevated train
towards the wigwams on F ourteenth street,
and going at the rate of four miles an hour.
“ We do not care especially who discovers 115

50 long as we hold control of the city organi-
zation. How about that, Hank ? ’'

“ That will be satisfactory,” said Mr. Hud-
son, taking a package of imported cheese and
eating it, so that they could have the car to
themselves.

Thus was New York discovered via Albany
and Fort Lee, and five minutes after the two
touched glasses‚ the brim of the schoppin and*
the Manhattan cocktail tinkled together, and
New York was inaugurated.
