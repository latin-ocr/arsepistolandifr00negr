142 HORACE GREELEY.

paper, “The New York Tribune,'' which at once took its stand as a
thoroughly appointed, independent, and spirited journal.

In July, he associated with him in its management as partner‚ Mr.
McElrath. With increased facilities, it was kept fully up to the needs of
the times, and became noted for its enterprise, and its full, early and cor-
rect news. As the organ of the tariff party, upholding anti-slavery,
advocating the cause of temperance, and other prominent topics of the
times, it soon became well-known, and a power in the land.

Mr. Greeley always took a leading part in the politics of the country,
belonging to the old Whig party. In 1848 he was elected a member of
the House of Representatives. In 1851 he visited Europe, and was
chosen chairman of one of the juries of the World's Fair at London.
On his return he published “ Glances at Europe,'’ letters written to the
“ Tribune.” In 18 5 3 he edited a volume of papers from the “ Tribune,’'
“Art and Industry as Represented in the Exhibition at the Crystal ,
Palace, New York.'’ Also “ Hints Towards Reforms,‘' addresses delivered
on various occasions. Mr. Greeley wrote his autobiography, which had
alarge sale3 this he revised and issued in octavo, with the new title of
“Recollections of a Busy Life.'' He also published “History of the
Struggle for Slavery Extension or Restriction in the U. S. from 1787 to
18 56,'’ which passed through several editions; and, “The Tribune
Almanac,’' a yearly mass of facts, particularly valuable to politicians;
a new edition of these photographed on stone, in 2 vols, was isued in 1869,
a most remarkable event in the annals of book making.

His great work is “The American Conflict: A History of the Great
Rebellion, its Causes, Incidents and Results ;'’ published in 2 vols, with ⁸
maps and illustrations, and sold by subscription 3 it reached the enormous
sale of 15o,ooo copies. Mr. Greeley's position, both before and during
the war, as one of the leaders on the side of the North, rendered his
action in going bail for Jefferson DaviS, when he was captured by Federal
troopS, a startling surprise. A storm of reproach beat upon him, and in
one of the most caustic articles that ever appeared in an American
newspaper he defended himself and put his enemies completely to
rout. His sword gleamed and his buckler shone when he was in a con-
troversy.

Yet Mr. Greeley was mild, warm-hearted, generous, and always seek-
ing to help the poor, the vicious and those who were struggling upward.
“ Go West, young man,’' he used to say, “ and grow up with the country.'·' -
