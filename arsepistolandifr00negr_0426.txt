CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER.

Distinguished Litterateur.

 

ᾅῇΟΗΗΝΑΜΞΤ, essayist, author of book5‚ and always a humorist,

j ΜΓ. Xl'aruer has graced American literature and is one of the

x brightest ornaments of his profession. His quiet humor ap-

ἓκέ pears in nearly all of his writings3 it is a kind of perpetual

sunshiue. It is not the humor that is manufactured, but is as

Ι spontaneous as the hillside fountain‚ and as clear and gentle

as the stream that fiows from it. For many years his fertile brain was

busy, and few authors who have written so much have finished their
work so well.

ΜΓ. lVarner was born in Plainfield, Massachusett5‚ September 12,

1829. He was a descendent of one of the Pilgrim Fathers‚ and so may

be supposed to have inherited a certain vigor and independence of char-
acter, sels-reliance and the ambition to master difficulties and accomplish
results. He graduated from Hamilton College, Clinton, N. Y.‚ where he
gained a reputation as a scholarly, thoughtful‚ and withal, humorous
essayist.

After spending a winter in Michigan which proved disastrous‚ two
years as a surveyor on the frontier‚ and then some time in the study of
law, he began the practice of his profession in Philadelphia. His tastes‚
however, did not fit him for the practice of law. Har-ing taken up his
residence in Hartford‚ Conn.‚ he became connected with the “ Hartford
Courant ” through Senator Joseph R. Hawley, its editor—iu-chief. It was
evident that he had now found the pursuit for which he was especially
qualified. His miscellaneous articles in this journal began to attract
attention. In 1870 he made numerous contributions to the paper which
were afterwards collected and published under the title of “ My Summer
in a Garden.'' This work gave him a wide reputation. He traced the
subtle connection between “ Pusley '‘ and ‘⁶ Original siuj’ and his droll
conceitS‚ playful satire and sparkling style interested and amused a large

circle of readers. It was conceded that a new writer had appeared whose

origigality was beyond dispute.
