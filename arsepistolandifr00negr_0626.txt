578 FELICIA DOROTHEA HEMANS.
The songs their souls rejoiced to hear, Murmuring the names of mighty men,
WVhen harps were in the hall, They bid our streams roll on ;
And each proud note made lance and spear And link high thoughts to ers-”y glen
Thrill ou the bannered wall ; Where valiant deeds were (lone.
The son gs that through our valleys green, ι’
sent on from age to age, Teach them your children round the hearth, ¹
Like his own river's voice, have been XVI-'en evemng fireS bum Olea-ra
The peasanffs heritage· And 111 the fields of harvest mirth,
And on the hills of deer:
The reaper sings them when the vale So shall each unforgotten word,
Is filled with plumy sheaves3 When far those loved ones roam,
The woodman, by the starlight pale Call back the heart which once it stirred
Cheered homeward through the leaves: To childhood's holy home.
And unto them the glaucing oars
A joyous measure keep, The green woods of their native land
WVhere the dark rocks that erest our shores Shall WhiSPffl' in the Straiss ἶ
Dash back the foaming deep· The voices of their household band
Shall sweetly speak again;
So let it be !—a light they shed The heathery heights in vision nse,
O’er each old fount and grove, there like the stag they roved ;—
A memory of the gentle dead, Sing to your sons those melodies‚
A lingering spell of love. The songs your fathers loved.

 

LANDING OF THE PILGRIM FATHERS.

 

HE breaking waves dashed high ' The ocean eagle soared
On a stern and rock—bound coast, From his nest by the white wave’s foam3
And the woods against a stormy sky And the rocking pines of the forest roal-ed·-
Their giant branches tossed ; This was their welcome home!
And the heavy night hung dark
The hills and waters 0⁹3, There were men with hoary hair,
When a band of exiles moored their bark AmidSt that pilgrim band τ
On the wild New England shore. thy had they come to wither there,
Away from their childhood‘s land?
Not as the conqueror comes, There was woman's fearless eye,
They, the true-hearted, came ; Lit by her deep love’s truth ;
Not with the roll of the stirring drums, There was manhood's brow serenely high,
And the trumpet that sings of fame3 And the fiery heart of youth.
Not as the flying come,
In silence and in fear ;—- What sought they thus afar?
They shook the depths of the desert's gloom Bright jewels Of the mine?
With their hymns of lofty cheer. The wealth of scas? the spoils of war 1³—
They sought a faith’s pure shrine!
Amidst the storm they sang, Ay, call it holy ground,
And the stars heard, and the sea; [rang The soil where first they trod : [found—-

And the sounding aisles of the dim woods They have left unstained what there they
To the anthem of the free. F reedom to worship God!
