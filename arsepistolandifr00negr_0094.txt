68 RICHARD HENRY STODDARD.

persons gathered and by their speeches ancl tokens of grecting did honor
to their venerable guest. The well-known poet, Mr. Ε. C. Stedman, pre-
sided, and among those who found it impossible to attend and sent letters
of regret were, James W hitcomb Riley‚ Bishop Foster, Hon. Andrew D.
white, William Allen Butler, Prof. Charles Eliot Norton and others.

An appreciative letter from Donald G. Mitchell (Ik Marvel), closed

with these words :
“There is not one of you who has a truer relish for the charming

ways in which that favorite poet can twist our good mother-English into ;
resonant shapes of verse. 1 pray you to tell him so, and that only the τ
weakness of age—quickened by this wintry March—keeps me from
putting in an ‘Adsum‚' at the roll-call of your guests.'' ¹

An eminent critic thus estimates Mr. Stoddard's literary merits ι f
“His mind is essentially poetical. All his works are stamped with earn-
estness. His style is characterized by purity and grace of expression.
He is a master of rythmical melody and his mode of treating a subject is
sometimes exquisitely subtle. In his poems there is no rude writing. ¹
All is finished and highly glazed. The coloring is warm, the costumes
harmonious‚ the grouping symmetrical. His poetry always possesses a ’
spiritual meaning. Every sound and sight in nature is to him a symbol
which strikes some spiritual chord. The trees that wave at his window,
and the moon that silvers his roof are to him things that play an intimate
part in his existence. Thus in all his poems will be found an echo from ‡
an internal to an external nature, the harmony resulting from the inti·
mate union of both.'’

At the dinner above referred to, James Whitcomb Riley contributed ’
these graceful lines:

O princely poet! kingly heir
Of gift divinely sent——

Your own—nor envy anywhere,
Nor voice of discontent.

Though, of ourselves, all poor are we,
And frail and weak of wing,

Your height is ours—your ecstusy,
Your glory‚ where you sing.

Most favored of the gods and great
In gists beyond our store,

We covet not your rich estate,
But prize our own the more.
