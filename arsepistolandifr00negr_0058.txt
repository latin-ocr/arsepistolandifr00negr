38

Soon rested those who fought; but thou
Who minglest in the harder strife

For truths which men receive not now,
Thy warfare only ends with life.

A friendless warfare! lingering long
T hrough weary (lay and weary year;
A wild and many—weaponed throng
Hang on thy front, and flank‚ and rear.

Yet nerve thy spirit to the proof,
And bleneh not at thy chosen lot;
The timid good may stand aloof,
The sage may frown-—yet faint thou not,

Nor heed the shaft too surely cast,
The foul and hissing bolt of scorn :

 

WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.

For with thy side shall dweH, at last,
The victory of endurance born.

Truth, crushed to earth, shall rise agaim
The eternal years of God are hers ;

But Error, wounded, writhes in pain,
And dies among his worshippers.

Yea, though thou lie upon the duct,
then they who helped thee flee in sear,

Die full of hope and manly trust,
Like those who fell in battle hero.

Another hand thy sword shall wield,
Another hand the standard wave,
Till from the trumpet's mouth is peeled

The blast of triumph o'er thy grave.

 

TO A WATERFOWL.

HITHER, 'midst falling dew,

All day thy wings have fanned.

While glow the heavens with the last At that far height, the cold, thin atinosphere,

steps of day,
Far through their rosy depths dost thou pursue
Thy solitary way?

Vainly the fowler’s eye
Might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong,
As, darkly painted on the erimson sky,

Thy figure floats along.

Seekst thou the plashing brink

Of weedy lake, or marge of river wide,

Or where the rocking billows rise and sink
On the chafed ocean side?

There is a power whose care
Teaehes thy way along that pathless coast—
The desert and illimitable air—

Lone wandering, but not lost.

 

Yet stoop not, weary, to the welcome land,
Though the dark night is near.

And soon that toil shall end;
Soon shalt thou find a summer home, and rest,
And scream among thy fellows ; reeds shall bend.
Soon, o’er thy sheltered nest.

Thou'rt gone, the abyss of heaven
Hath swallowed up thy form; yet, on ιιι)7 heart
Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given,
And shall not soon depart.

He who, from zone to zone,
Guides through the boundless sky thy certain
In the lfhlffgtiivay that Ι must tread alone,
Will lead my steps aright.

THE ARCTIO LOVER.

ONE is the long, long winter night;
Look, my beloved one; ssight,

Ay, ’tis the long bright summer day;
Hark to the mighty crash!

How glorious through its depth of The loosened ioe-ridge breaks away—-

Rolls the majestis: sun!
The willows waked from winter's depth,
Give out a fragrance like thy breath—
Tho summer is begun !

The smitten waters flash.
Seaward the glittering mountain rides,
While down its green translucent sides,
The foamy torrents dash,
