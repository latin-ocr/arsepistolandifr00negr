JOAQUIN MILLER.

Author of “ Songs of the Sierras,”

 

HIS poet of the Rockies'’ has had an eventful career, one that
has not been free from romance on the one hand, or hard
reality on the other. He is a “diamond in the rough.'‘ His
real genius has never been fully recognized, and this appears
to be due to his lack of the highest culture and refinement.
He is a man of the woods and mountains.

Mr. Miller's early life was spent mostly on our western frontiers‚
and the scenes of many of his writings are laid in the West. He was
born in Cincinnati, Ohio‚ November 10, 1842. His Christian name is
Cincinnatus Heme, but this appears to have been substituted by him for
“Joaquin.'’ His family having removed to the far West, he was a resi-
dent of Oregon in 1852. He began a roving life four years later, and
sei-ved for a time with the filibuster‚ Walker‚ in Honduras.

He began the practice of law in Oregon in 1860. The Civil W ar
was in progress in 1863, and a newspaper that he edited was suppressed
for disloyalty. He was afterward made county J udge for Grant county,
showing that he had gained the esteem and confidence of the com-
munity.

During all these years he devoted some part of his time to author-
ship‚ writing poenis and prose romances, His vivid imagination was led
captive by the romantic scenery of the far West and the tales of heroic
adventure current on the frontiers. In 1870 he visited Europe. His
first volume of verse, “ Songs of the Sierras‚'' was published in England
in 1871.

This gave him a measure of fame, and his eccentricities and western
style of dress appeared to increase the interest his genius had awakened.
He afterward settled as a journalist in Washington, and in 1887 111 0311..
fornia. In 1890 he revisited England‚ yet without attracting the attention
that attended his first visit. “Songs of the Sunlands '' was issued in
England in 1873, and this volume was followed by “The Ship in the

Desert ’' and “The First Families of the Sierras.'' Later works‚ chiefly
