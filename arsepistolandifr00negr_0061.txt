But on the hill the golden rod, and the aster And sighs to find them in the wood and by the

’ in the wood,
And the yellow sun-flower by the brook in

autumn beauty stood,
Till fell the frost from the clear, eold heaven,

as falls the plague on men,
Anu the brightness of their smile was gone

from upland, glade and glen.

And now, when eomes the calm, mild day, as

still such days will come,
To call the squirrel and the bee from out their

winter home

stream no inore.

And then I think of one who in her youthful
beauty died,

The fair, meek blossom that grew up and faded

by my side :

In the cold moist earth we laid her when the

forest east the leaf,

And we wept that one so lovely should have a

life so brief;
Yet not unmeet it was, that one, like that

young friend of ours

When the sound of dropping nuts is heard, So gentle and so beautiful, should perish with

though all the trees are still,

the flowers.

 

ΤΟ THE FRINGED GENTIAN.

HOU blossom‚ bright with autumn dew,
And eolored with the heaven’s own blue,
T hat openest when the quiet light
Sueeeeds the keen and frosty night;

Thou eamest not when violets lean

O'er wandering brooks and springs unseen,
Or eolumbines, in purple dressed,

N od o’er the ground-bird‘s hidden nest.

Thou waitest late, and eom’st alone,
then woods are bare and birds are flown,

 

And frosts and shortening days portend
The aged year is near his end.

Then doth thy sweet and quiet eye
Look through its fringes to the sky,
Blue—blue - ns if that sky let fall
A flower from its cerulean wall.

I would that thus, when I shall see
The honr of death draw near to me,
Hope, blossoming with my heart,
May look to heaven as Ι depart.

 

THE: MURDERED TRAVELER.

HEN spring to woods and wastes armmd,
Brought bloom and joy again ;

The murdered traveler’s bones were

Far down a narrow glen. [found,

The fragrant biroh, above him, hung
Her tassels in the sky3

And many a vernal blossom sprung,
And nodded careless by.

The red bird warbled‚ as he wrought
His hanging nest o'erhead .

And fearless, near the fal al spot,
Her young tho partridge led.

 

But there was weeping far away,
And gentle eyes, for him,

With watehing many an anxious day,
lVere sorrowful and dim.

They little knew, who loved him so,
The fearful death he met,

then shouting o’er the desert snow,
Unarmed and hard beset;

Nor how, when round the frosty pole
The northern dawn was red,
The mountain-wolf and wild-cat stole

To banquet 011 the dead.
