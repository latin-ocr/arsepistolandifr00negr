FRANCIS RICHARD STOCKTON.

“ The 6366 was about a man named Brown,
who married the half sister of a man named
Adams, who afterward married Brown’s
mother an' sold Brown a house he had got
from Browu’s grandfather in trade for half a
grist mill, which the other half of it was
owned by Adams’ half-sister's first husband,
who left all his property to a Soup Society, in
trust, till his son should come of age, which
he never did, but left a will which gave his
half of the mill to Brown; an‘ the suit was
between Brown an’ Adams an' Brown again,
an’ Adams' half-sister, who was divorced from
Brown, an' a man named Ramsey, who had
put up a new overshot wheel to the grist mill.

“ That 6366 wasn’t aeasy one to understand,
as you may see for yourself, an’ it didn't get
finished that day. They argyed over it a full
week. XVhen there wasn’t no more witnesses
to carve up, one lawyer made a speech, an'
he set that crooked case up so straight that
you could see through it from the over-shot
wheel clean back 10 Brown’s grandfather.
Then another feller made a speech an' he. set
the whole thing up another way.

“ It was jus' as clear to look through but
it was another case altogether, 110 111016 like
the other one 111311 3 3111116 1116 is like a mug
o’ cider. An’ then they both took it up, an’

377

they swung it around between ’6111 1111 11 was
all twisted an’ knotted an' wound up an’
tangled worse than a skein o’ yarn in a nest
o' kittens, an' then they give it to the jury.

“Well, when then] j urymen went out there
wasn’t none of 'e1n, 36 Jone told 1116 after-
ward, 36 knew whether it was Brown or
Adains as was dead, or whether the mill was
to grind soup or 10 be run by soup power.
Of course, they couldn't agree. Three of ’6111
wanted to give 3 verdict for 1116 boy that died,
two of ’eln was for Brown's grandfather, an' the
rest was scattered, 601116 goin' in for daniages
to the witnesses, who ought to get somethin’
sor huvin' their characters ruined. Jone he
j us‘ held back ready to jine the other eleven
36 60011 36 they'd agreed. ,

“But they couldn't do it, an’ they were
locked up three days an' four night-s. You‘d
better believe I got pretty wild about it, but Ι
come to court every day an' waited‚ bringin'
somethin’ to eat in a basket. June neverhad
no chance to jine in with the other fellers, for
they couldn’t agree, an‘ they were all dis-
charged at last. So the whole thing went for
nothin'. When Jone come out he locked like
he'd been drawn through a pumpdog, and he
says to nie, tired like:

‘⁴ ‘ Let s go home an’ settle down 1 ' '’
