gained the lot. This was tried three times.
As Larkin held the stick twice out of three
times, he had the choice. He hesitated a
moment. Everybody looked toward tall J im
Phillips. But Larkiu was fond of a venture
on unknown seas, and so he said, “I take the
master,'’ while a buzz of surprise ran round
the room, and the captain of the other side,
as if afraid his opponent would withdraw
thc choice, retorted quickly, and with a little
smack of exultation and defiance in his voice:
¹⁶ And Itake Jeems Phillips.'’

And soon all present, except a few of the
old folks, found themselves ranged in oppos-
ing hosts, the poor spellers lagging in, wilh
what grace they could at the foot of the twe
divisions. The Squire opened his spelling—
book and began to give out the words to the
two captains‚ who stood up and spelled
against each other. It was not long before
Larkin spelled ‘⁶ really ’' with one l, and had
to sit down in confusion, while a murmur
of satisfaction ran through the ranks of the
opposing forces. His own side bit their lips.
The slender figure of the young teacher took
the place of the fallen leader, and the excite-
ment made the house very quiet.

Ralph dreaded the loss of influence he
would suffer if 116 should be easily spelled
down. And at the moment of rising he saw
in the darkest corner the figure of a well-
dressed young man sitting in the shadow. It
made him tremble. Why should his evil
genius haunt him? But by a strong effort he
turned his attention away from Dr. Small,
and listened carefully to the words which the
Squire did not pronounce very distinct]y‚
spelling them with extreme deliberation.
This gave him 611 air of hesitation which dis-
appointed those 011 his own side. They wanted
him to spell with a dashing assurance. But
he did not begin a word until he had mentally
felt his way through it.

After ten minutes of spelling hard words,
ψ Jeems Buchanan, the captain of the other
side, spelled “ atrocious ' with an s instead of
a c, and subsided, his first choice, Jeems Phil-
lips, coming up against the teacher. This
brought the excitement to sever-beat. For
though Ralph was chosen first, it was entirely

011 trust, and most of the company were dis-
appointed. The champion who now stood up
against the school-master was a famous speller.

Jim Phillips was a tall, lank, stoop-shoul-
dered fellow, who had never distinguished
himself in any other pursuit than spelling.
Except in this one art of spelling he was of
no account. He could neither catch a ball well
or bat well. He could not throw well enough
to make his mark in that famous VVestern
garne of Bull-pen. He did not succeed well
in any study but that of W‘ebster‘s Elemen-
tary. Butin that—to use the usual Flat Creek
locution—he was “a hoss.'' The genius for
spelling is in some people a sixth sense, a
matter of intuition. Some spellers are born
and not made, and their facility reminds one
of the mathematical prodigies that crop out
every now and then to bewilder the world.

Bud Means, foreseeing that Ralph would
be pitted against J im Phillips, had warned his
friend that Jim could spell “like thunder and
lightning,'' and that it “took a powerful
smart speller” to beat him, for he knew “ a
heap of spelling—hook.'’ To have “spelled
down the master '' is next thing to having
whipped the biggest bully in Hoophole
County, and Jim had “spelled dx›wn'’ the
last three masters. He divided the hero-
worship of the district with Bud Means.

For half an hour the Squire gave out hard
words. What a hlessed thing our crooked
orthography is. Without it there could be
no spelling-schools. As Ralph discovered his
opponent's mettle he became more and more
cautious. He was now satisfied that Jim
would eventually beat 111111. The fellow evi-
dently knew more about the spelling-book
than old Noah XVebster himself. As he stood
there, with his dull face and long sharp nose,
his hands behind his back, and his voice spell-
ing infallibly, it seem to Hartsook that his
superiority must lie in his nose,

Ralph’s cautiousness answered a double
purpose ; it enabled him to tread surely, and
it was mistaken by Jim for weakness. Phil-
lips was now confident that 116 should carry
off the scalp of the fourth school-master
before the evening was over. He spelled
eagerly, confidently. brilliantly. Stoop-shoul-
