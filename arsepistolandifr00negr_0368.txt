through the bosom of their unfortunate pos-
sessor warns him of the ruin that is com-
ing‘ upon him. A stranger presents him-
self. Introduced to their civilities by the
rank which he had lately held in his country,
he soon finds his way to their hearts by the
dignity and elegancc of his demeanor, the
light and beauty ot' his conversation, and the
seductivc and fascinating power of his 1111111633.
The conquest was not difficult. Innocence is
ever simple and credulous. Conscious of no
design itself‚ it suspects 110116 111 others. It
wears no guard before its breast. Every
door and portal and avenne of the heart is
thrown open, and all who choose it enter.

Such was the state of Edon when the ser-
pent entered its bowerS. The prisoner, in a
more engaging form, winding himself into
the open and unpracticed heart of the unforu-
nate Blannerhassett, found but little difficulty
in changing the native character of that heart
and the objects of its affection. By degrees
he infusos into it the poison of his own am-
bition. He breathes into it the fire of his
own courage; a daring and desperate thirst
sor glory ; 111111 ardor panting for great enter-
1111363, for all the storm and bustle and hurri-
cane of life. In a short time the whole man
is changed, and every object of his former
dclights is relinquished. No more he enjoys
the tranquil scene; it has become flat and
insipid to his taste.

His books are abandoned. His retort and
crucible are thrown aside. His shrubbery
blooms and breathes its fragrancc upon the
air 111 vain; he likes it not. His ear nolonger
drinks the rich melody of musi03 it longs for
the trumpet's clangor and the cannon's roar.

of his soul. His imaginatiou has been dazzled
by visions of diadems, of stars and garters,
and titles of nobility. He has been taught
to burn with restless emulation at the names
of great heroes and conquerors. His en-
chanted island is destined soon to rclapsc into
a wilderness; aud in a few months we find
the beautiful and tcndcr partner of his bosom,

Yet this un fortunate man, thus deluded from
his interest and his happiness, thus seduced
