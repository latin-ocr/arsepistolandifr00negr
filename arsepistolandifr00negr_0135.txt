JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER. 101

Where the whitest lilies blow,
Where the freshest berries grow,
Where the ground-nul: trails its vine,
WVhere the wood-grape’s clusters shine‚
Of the blaek wasp’s cunning way,
Mason of his walls of clay,

And the architectural plans

Of gray hornet artisans!

For, eschewing books and tasks,
Nature answers all he asks;

Hand in hand with 1101· 110 walks,
Part and pareel of 1101· joy,

Blessings on the barefoot boy.

Ο for boyhood's time of June,
Crowding years in 0110 brief moon,
YVhen all things I heard or saw,

Me, 111011· master, waited for!

I was rieh in flowers and trees,
Humming-birds and honey bees;
For my sport the squirrel played,
Plied 1110 5110111011 mole his spade;
For my taste the blaekberry 00110
Purpled over hedge and 510110;
Laughed the brook for my delight‚
Through the day, and through the night
Whispering at the gai-den wall,
Talked with me from fall to fall ;
Mine the saud-rimmed pickerel pond,

Mine the walnut slopes beyond,
Mine, on bending orehard trees,
Apples of Hesperides!

still, as my horizon grew,
Larger grew myriehes 100,

All the world I saw or knew
Seemed a complex Chinese toy,
Fashioned for a barefoot boy!

Cheerily‚ then, my little man!

Live and laugh as boyhood ean ;
Though 1110 flinty slopes be hard,
Stubble-speared 1110 new-mown sward,
Every mom shall lead 11100 through
Fresh baptisms of the dew 3

Every evening from thy feet

Shall the cool wind kiss the heat3
All too soon these feet must hide

In the prison cells of pride,

Lose 1110 freedom of the sod,

Like a eolt's for work be shod,

Made 10 tread the mills of toil,

Up and down in eeaseless moil,
Happy if their traek be found
Never on forbidden ground ;

Happy if they sink not in

Quiek and treacherous sands of sin.
Ah! that thou couldst know thy joy,
Ere 11 passes, barefoot boy!
