HORACE GREELEY.

The Peerless Journalist.

Α x, 1γῖ Τ has been remarked by some one that it was once customary in
¹ towns on our western frontier to swear witnesses in court on a
. copy of the “ New York Tribune,’' if it should so happen that
no Bible was handy. This will do very well to illustrate the
vast influence Mr. Greeley's famous journal possessed. It was
“law and gospel “ in many parts of our country. Men knew
what they believed as soon as they found out what Horace Greeley believed.

Mr. Greeley was born of plain parents at Amherst, N. H., February
3, 1811. He received a limited common school education, which he
improved by application to private studies, his pursuit of knowledge
was carried on with unwearied activity.· When fourteen years old, his
father removed to Vermont, and he became an apprentice in the office of
the “Northern Spectator,'' at Pultney, Vt. He returned home in 1830,
at the discontinuance of the paper, but soon after, his father having
removed to Chatauqua Co.‚ N. Y„ on the Pennsylvania line, he became
an apprentice in Erie, Pa„ for fifty dollars a year, Out of this small
sum, he gave his father more than one—half, and in August, 1831, started
for 'New York, and entered the city, the scene of his future labors and
triumphs, with a suit of blue cotton jean, two brown shirts, and five
dollars in cash, as his working capital.

He worked at his trade as J ourneyman printer for eighteen months.
In 1834, in conjunction with Jonas Winchester, he commenced the publi-
cation of the “New Yorker,'' a weekly paper of sixteen pages, quarto.
Though conducted, for several years, with much ability as a political and
literary journal, it was abandoned as unsuccessful. Mr. Greeley also
conducted the “Jeffersonian'’ for the Whig Central Committee of tl1e
⁷ State, and for six months the “ Log Cabin,'’ a campaign paper in the

presidentia] election of 1840.

On Saturday‚ April 10, 1841, appeared the first number of his new
