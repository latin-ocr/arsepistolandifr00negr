Some lovers say, “ Come to my arms! ''
And quick the maiden jumps ;

But Peter changed the phrase and said,
“ Come, darling, to my stumps! ''

Long time did Peter long to wed,
His true and faithful mate3

The lovers felt a weight of woe,
Because compelled to wait.

The Captain had no stocks or bonds,
No horses and no lands;

And, without arms, he could not take
A wife upon his hands.

For keeping books he had a taste,
Yet had to shun the pen ;

But if a pension could be had,
He would get married then.

The pension came, the wedding too,
His fortunes to retrievc ;

“ Please join your hands‚'’ the parson said,
But Peter joined his sleeve.

Now Peter’s joy is quite complete,
And peaceful is his life z

While marriage was a happy stroke,
He never strikes his wife.

LAKE} ERIE.
ΒΥ EPHRAIM PEABODY.

Born at Wilton, New Hampshire, in 1807 ; died in 1856.

HESE lovely shores! how lone and still

A hundred years ago,
The unbroken forest stood above,
The waters dashed below:
The waters of a lonely sea,
Where never sail was furled,
Embosomed in a wilderness,

Which was itself a world.

A hundred years! go back ; and lo!
VVhere, closing in the view,

Just out the shore, with rapid oar
Darts round a frail canoe.

'Tis a white voyager, and see,
His prow is westward set

O'er the calm wave: hail to thy bold,

World-seeking harh, Marquette 1

The lonely bird, that picks his fond
WVhere rise the waves, and sink,

At their strange con1i¹1g‚witl1shrillscream,
Starts from the sandy brink ;

The fishhawk, hanging in mid sky,
Floats o'er on level wing,

And the savage from his covert looks,
With arrow on thr· sti-ing.

A hundred years are past and gone,
And all the rock y coast

Is turreted with shining towns,
An empire's noble boast.

And the old wilderness is changed
To cultnred vale and hill;

And the circuit of its mountains
An empire’s numbers ffll.
