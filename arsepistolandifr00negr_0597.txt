THOMAS HOOD.

But when he called on Nelly Gray,
She made him quite a senff, ⁷

And when she saw his wooden legs,
Began to take them off!

“ O Nelly Gray! Ο Nelly Gray!
Is this your love so warm ἶ)

Τ116 love that loves a searlet coat,
Should be more uniform ! ’²

Said she, “ Ι loved a soldier 01166,
For he was blithe and brave3

But Ι will never have a man
With both legs in the grave!

‘⁴ Before yon had those timber 1065
Your love Ι did allow,

But then you know, you stand upon
Another footing now! '’

 

Though I've no feet—some other man
Is standing in my shoes!

“ Ι wish I ne’er had seen your faee;
But, now, a long farewell!

For you will be my death :—alas!
You will not be my Nell ! ’'

Now when he went from Nelly Gray,
His heart so heavy got—

And life was such a burthen grown,
It made him take a knffl 1

So round his melancholy 111οκ
A rope he did entwine,

And, for his second time 111 lise,
Enlisted in the Line!

One end he tied around a beam,
And 111611 removed his pegs,

''‘ O Nelly Gray! O Nelly Gray!
For all your cheering speeches,
At duty's call I left my legs
In Badajos’s breaches ‚f ''

And, as his legs were off—-of course,
He soon was off his legs!

And there he hung till he was dead
As any nail iu town-—

‘⁴ Why, them„ said She, “YOU’Vss lOSt the feet For though distress had cut him up,
Of legs in war'S alanus> It could n‹›t cut him down 1

And now you cannot wear your shoes ·

Upon your feats of arms! ’' A dozen 111611 sat on his corpse,

To find out why he died——
And they buried Ben in four cross—roads,

‘⁴ O, false and fickle Nelly Gray; xvjth a snake in his iuside ¹

I know why you refuse :—

 

JOHN DAY.
A Day After the Fair.—OLD PROVERB.

The famous author styles this “A Pathetie Ballad.'' The reador will understand that
the “ Crown '’ is the name of an English public house and the “ Da1·t⁷‘ is the name ofa stage-
coach. The term “stone ” means, in England, 1011116611 pounds when applied to a person’s
weighit. “ Carried sixteen stone ” implies that the portly eoachman, John Day, weighed 224
poun 5.

ΟΗΝ DAY he was the-biggest man
Of all the eoachman kind,
With back too broad to be conceived
By any narrow mind.

Soon Cupid sent an arrow through
His searlet coat of mail.

The bar-maid of the Crown he loved,
From whom he never ranged,
For though he changed his horses there,

The very horse knew his weight
His love he never changed.

When he was in the rear,
And wished his box a Christmas-box

He thought her fairest of all fares,
To come but once a year.

So fondly love prefers;
And often, among twelve outsides,

Alas! against the shafts of love,
Deemed no outside like hers.

What armor can avail?
