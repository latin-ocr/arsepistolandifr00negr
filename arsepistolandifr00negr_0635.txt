A PASSAGE AT ARMS.
111οΜ ADAM BEDE.‘²

ARTLE MASSEY returned from the l
Β tire—place, where he had been smoking 1

his first pipe in quiet, and broke the
silence by saying, 35 110 thrust his forefinger
into the canister, “ Why, Adam, how hap-
pened you not to be at church on Sunday‘?
answer me that, you rascal. The anthem
went limping without you. Are you going to
disgrace your schoolmaster in his old age ἱ) ”

“No, Mr. Massey‚’' said Adam. “Mn
and Mrs. Poyser 0311 1011 you where I was. I
was in 110 bad company.''

“She's gone, Adam, gone to Snowfield,'’
said Mr. Poyser‚ reminded of Dinah for the
first time this evening. “I thought you'd
ha' persuaded her better. Nought 'ud hold
her but she must go yesterday forenoon. The
miaeis has hardly got over it. I thought she’d
ha’ no sperrit for th’ harvest supper.’'

Mrs. Poyser had thought of Dinah several
times since Adam had come 111, but she had
had “ 110 110311 ” 10 mention the bad news.

“ What! '' said Bar-tle, with an air of dis-
gust. ‘⁴ &Vas there a woman concerned?
Then I give you up, Adam.''

“But it’s a woman you've spoke well on,
Bartle‚’' said Mr. Poyser. ‘⁴ Come, now, you
canna draw back3 you said once as women
would n't ha' been a bad invention if they’d
all been like Dinah.”

“I meant her voice, man—I meant her
voice, that was all‚’' said Bartle. “I 0311
bear to hear her speak without wanting to put
wool in my ears.
(1310 say she’s like the rest o’ the women—

thinks two and two‘ll come to make five, if ’

5110 01105 and bothers enough about it.”

“Ay, ay!'’ said Mrs. Poyser‚ “one ’ud
think, an’ 11031 501110 folks talk, as the men
war' cute enough to count the 001115 111 3 bag
o’ wheat wi’ only smelling at it. They 0311
500 through 3 113111 (1001, they 0311. Perhaps
that’s the reason they can see so little this
side on‘t.’'

Martin Poyser shook with delighted laughter,
and winked at Adam as much as to say the
school-master was in for it now.

As for other things, 1*

 

“ Ah 1 ” said Bartle‚ sneeringly‚ ‘¹ the women
310 quick enough, they're quick enough. They
know the rights of a story before they hear it,
and can tell 3 111311 what his thoughts are
before he knows ’0111 himself.''

“Like enough,’' said Mrs. Poyser‚ “for the
men are mostly so slow, their thoughts over-
run 'em an’ they 0311 only catch ’0111 by' the
tail. Ι cau count a stocking-top while 3 111311’5·
getting's tongue ready ; an’ when 110 outs wi'
his speech at last, there’s little broth to be
made on't. It’s your dead chicks takes the
longest hatchin’. However, I'm not denyin’
the women are foolish ; God Almighty made
’em to match the men.”

“Mamm” said Bartle; “ ay, as vinegar
matehes one’s teeth. If a man says 3 1101(1,
1115 wife’ll match it with a contradiction ; if
he’s a mind for hot meat, his wife'll match it
with cold bacon; if he laughs, she'll match
him with whimperings. She’s such a match
as th' horse-fly 15 10 111’ 110150 ; 5110’5 got the
right venom to sting him with—the right
venom to sting him with.’'

“Yes,’' said Mrs. Poyser‚ “I know what

,
’ 1110 111011 like—a poor soft, as ’ud simper at

’0111 like the pictur 0' the sun, whether they

' did right or wrong, an' say thank you for 3

kick, an' pretend she didna know which end
she stood uppermost, till her hu band told her
That’s what 3 111311 1131115 111 3 wife, mos 5111*;

wi’ out that—they think so much o’ them-
selves a'ready ; an' that's how it is there's old
bachelors.''

“,Come Craig, ” said Mr. Poyser‚ jocos 5011,

“you mun get married pretty quick 015 50 y 011 ’ll
be set down for an old bachelor; an' you 500
what the women ’ll think on you,'

“''WelL said Mr. Craig‚ willing to conciliate
Mrs. Poyser‚ and setting 3 high value 011 his
own compliments, “ Ι like 3 cleverish woman
-3 woman 0’ sperrit——a managing woman. '’

“Yo’u re out there, Craig,” said Bartle,
dryly; you' re out there. You judge o' your
garden— stuff 011 3 better plan 111311 that; you
