The causes that have sharpened his percep-

music and verse. It is a fact often observed
that men have written good verses under the
inspiration of passion, who cannot write well
under any other circumstances

The like force has the passion over all his
nature. It expands the sentiment3 it makes

 

the elown gentle, and gives the coward heare.
Into the most pitiful and abject it will infuse
a beart and courage to defy the world, so only
it have the countenance of the beloved object.
In giving him to another, it still more gives
him to himself. He is a new man, with new

MOUNTAIN AND SQUIRREL.

HE mountain and the squirrel

Had a quarrel ;
And the- former called the latter “ Little

Prig.’'
Bun replied:
“ You are doubtless very big ;
But all sorts of things and weather

Must be taken in together,
To make up a year
And a sphere.

And I think it no disgrace

To occupy my place.

If I’m not so large as yon,

You are not so small as I,

And not half so spry.

I’ll not deny you make

A very pretty squirrel track ;

Talents differ ; all is well and wisely put 3
If Ι cannot carry forests on my back,
Neither can you crack a nut.''
