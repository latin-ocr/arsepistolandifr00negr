ORADLE SONG.
FROM “ ΒΙΤΤΕΒ SWEET.”

HAT is the little one thinking about?
Very wonderful things, no doubt;
Unwritten history!
Unfathomed mystery 1 [winks
Yet he chuckles, and crows, and nods and
As if his head were as full of kinks
And curious riddles as any sphinx!
Warped by colic, and wet by tears,
Punctured by pins, and tortured by fears,
Our little nephew will lose two years;
And he'll never know
WVhere the summers go ;
He need not laugh, for he'll find it 50.

Who can tell what a baby thinks?
Who can follow the gossamer links

By which the manikin feels its way
Out from the shores of the great unknown,
Blind, and wailing, and alone,

Into the light of the day?
Out from the shore of the unknown sea,
Tossing in pitiful agony;
Of the unknown sea that reels and rolls‚
Specked with the barks of little 501115,-
Barks that were launched on the other side,

And slipped from heaven on an ebbing tide!
What does he think of his mother's eyes 2²

What does he think of his mother's hair?
that of the cradle-roof, that flies

Forward and backward through the air?

What (1065 116 think of his mother’s breasis,
Bare and beautiful, sniooth and white,
Seeking it ever with fresh delight,
Cup of his life, and conch of his rest?
that does he think when her quick elnbrace
Presses 1115 hand and buries his face
Deep where the heart-throbs sink and swelL
With a tenderness she never can tell,
Though she murmur the words
Of all the birds—

lVords she has learned to murmur well?
Now he thinks he’ll go to sleepl
Ι can see the shadow creep

Over his eyes in soft eclipse,

Over his brow and over his lips,

Out of his little finger-tips!

Softly sinking, down he goes!

Down he goes! down hc goes!

See! he's hushed in sweet repose.

 

THA'I' YOUNG WOMAN.
FROM “ TITCOMB’s LETTERSJ’

F any young woman, in a boarding-school
or out of it, should find herself a subject
of any of the diseases which I have

pointed out, she should seek a remedy at once.
If she finds herself moved to go shopping for
the simple purpose of talking with the clerks,
let her remember that she is not only doing
an immodest and unbecoming thing, but that
she is manifesting the symptoms of that which
is a dangerous mental disease. To begin with,

Again, she 15 doing that which compromises
her in the eyes of all sensible young men. If
she finds herself possessed with unaccountable

similarly afflicted, or any one of a hundred
absorbing sentiment-alisms, let her remember
that she is mentally and morally sick, and
that, for her own comfort and peace, she
should seek at once for a remedy.
