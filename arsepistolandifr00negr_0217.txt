Δ 5 „f [θλ HERE are many authors who are more widely known for some

{3²⁷7 ,ἲ single production, perhaps brief, than they are for any elaborate
ἕ and voluminous works, The only poem by which Thomas
Grey is celebrated is his “ Elegy in a Country Churchyard‚”
yet it will carry his name down through time.

Mrs. Allen has not written volumes3 she is not to oe meas-
ured by quantity so much as by quality. She was born at Strong,
» Maine, October 9, 1832. She became a contributor to various magazines

and under the pseudonym of “ Florence Percy '' became widely known as
an author. A volume of poems published in 1867 was favorably received.
In 1860‘she became the wife of Paul Ackers, the sculptor, but survived
her husband, and some time after his death was married to Mr. E. M.
Allen of New York. ⁷

Her painstaking work has been widely appreciated‚ and while her
‘productions are not so abundant as those of many others, she has gained
an enviable distinction as a graceful writer, with fine poetic taste. Her
beautiful poeni entitled‚ “ Rock me to Sleep, Mother‚'' has become a
household treasure. It exalts and ennobles motherhood‚ and its tender
pathos is universally admitted.
