LORD BYRON.

Some momente, ay, one treacherous hour,
We still might doubt the tyrant’s power;
So fair, so calm, so softly sealed,

The first, last look by Dezzth revealed l
Such is the aspect of this shore:

’Tis Greece, but living Greece no more 1
So coldly sweet‚ so deadly fair,

We start—for soul is wanting there.

Here is the loveliness in death

That parts not quite with parting breath:

’ But beauty with that fearful bloom,

That here which haunts it to the tomb ;

Expression’s last receding ray,

A gilded halo hovering round decay,

The farewell bearn of Feeling passed away 1

Spark of that flame, perchance of heavenly
birth,

Which gleams, but warms no more its cher-
ished earth!

Clime of the unforgotten brave!

Whose land, from plain to mountain-cave,
Was Freedom's home, or glory’s grave!
Shrine of the mighty! can it be

That this is all that remains of thee?
Approach, thou craven, crouching slave!

499

Say, is not this Thermopylae?

These waters blue that round you lave,—
O servile offspring of the free—
Pronounce—what sea, what shore is this?
The gulf‚ the rock of Salamis!

These soenes, their story not unknown,
Arise, and make again your own ‚³
Snateh from the ashes of your sires

The embers of their former fires ;

And he who in the strife expires

Will add to theirs a name of sear

That tyranny shall quake to hear,

And leave his sons a hope, a fame,

They too will rather die than shame; ,
For Freedom’s battle once begun,
Bequeathed by bleeding sire to son,
Though baffled oft, is ever won.

Bear witness, Greece, thy living page!
Attest it many a deathless age!

While kings, in dusky darkness hid,

Have left a nameless pyramid,

Thy heroes—though the general doom
Hath swept the column from their tomb,—
A mightier monument command,

The mountains of their native land!

There points the Mnse to stranger’s eye
The graves of those—that cannot die ἔ

GREEOE.

ET are thy skies as blue, thy crags as wild‚
Υ Sweet are thy groves and verdant are

thy fields,
Thine olive ripe as when Minerva smiled;
And still his honeyed wealth Hymettus yields.

 

There the blithe bee his fragrant fortress builds,
The free-born wanderer of thy mountain air ;
Apollo still thy long, long summer gilds;
Still in his bearn Mendeli's marbles glare;
Art, glory, freedom fail, but nature still is fair.

APOSTROPHE TO THE OGEAN.

OLL on, thou deep and dark blue ocean—

roll ἶ)

Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in

vain:
Man marks the earth with ruin-his control

Stops with the shore;-—upon the watery

plain

The wrecks are all thy deed, nor doth re-

mam
A shadow of man’s ravage, save his own,

 

 

 

'Whem for a moment, like a drop of rain,
He sinksinto thy depths with bubbling groan,
Without a grave, unknelled, uncoffined, and
unknown.

His steps are not upon thy paths—thy fields
Are not a spoil sor him—thou dost arise
And shake him from thee; the vile strength

he yields
For earth's destruction thou dost all despise
