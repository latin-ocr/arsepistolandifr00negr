DANIEL WEBSTER. 275

advice of his friends, and without help or encouragement, he set to work
to study law. After he could learn no more from the country lawyers,
he went to Boston. Step by step, with patience, judgment, and hard
work, he made his way to the Boston bar and finally to Congress, where
he went far beyond his father's fondest hope, and took rank at once
among the greatest men of the nation.

Whether representing the Granite State in Congress, following his
profession in Boston, or during the long periods when he stood for Massa-
chusetts‚ first as a Congressman and later as a Senator, or when he served
under the Harrison-Tyler and the Fillmore administrations as Secretary
of State—altogether a period of almost forty years—Mr. NVebster devoted
himself with zeal and wisdom to all the greatest public matters of his
time, both in law and in politics. His influence in many important
steps in our country's progress is felt to this day, and will always be felt
as long as the nation exists.

He had a magnificent power of setting forth truth; his eloquent,
forcible words3 his profound knowledge, his deep, musical voice, and
his commanding figure, carried the opinions of judges, juries, and
spectators into the current of his own arguments.

Much of Mr. VVebster's fame also rests upon the public orations
which he made in honor of great national events. The first of these
was delivered at Plymouth in 1820, on the anniversary of the landing of
the Pilgrims. Five years later he gave another, when the corner-stone
for the Bunker Η111 Monument was laid3 which was followed by still
another when the monument was finished in 1843. But the most brilliant
of all, perhaps, was the eulogy on the two great patriots, Thomas Jeffer-
son and John Adams, who died the same day, just fifty years after the
Declaration of Independence, which one wrote for Congress and the other
read before it.

On his record as Senator everything else is cast in the shadow by
his famous reply to Robert Y. Hayne, of South Carolina, in what is
always known as the Great Debate of the Senate. Never, before or
after, did the genius of Daniel Webster rise to such wonderful power
as in those two days, January 26 and 27, 183o,'when, denying the right
of any State to “nullify ’' the Federal laws, he defended the Union and
the Constitution in the most remarkable soeech ever delivered in either
house of the United States Congress

He had no thought of gaining literary fame by it, and yet the
