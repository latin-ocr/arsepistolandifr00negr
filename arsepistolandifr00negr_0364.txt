LUCY LARC 0111.
“Poetess of the Lowell Mills.”

 

UDE noise of spindles mingled with the notes of her lyre, but
the notes of her lyre were quite as sweet and entrancing as if
strangers to the elatter of unpoetieal machinery. She says:
“ Ι entered the spinning-room, then the dressing-room, where 1
had a place beside pleasant windows looking toward the river.
Later 1 was promoted to the eloth-romu, where Ι had fewer

hours of eonfinement, without the noisy macffinery, and it was altogether

neater.'' 0

Lucy Larcom, child of poverty and poesy, went into the cotton
faetory to help support her family. The operatives published a little
paper entitlecl‚ “ Offering.’' From being a contributor to this modest
sheet‚ she rose to the position of eontributor to the “ Atlantie M011th1y,'’
and finally, after becoming educated and teaching in the leading 50110015
of Massachusetts‚ she published several works of literary merit.

These are: “ Ships in the Mist and Other Stories 3 '' “ Breathings
of a Better Life;'‘ “ An Idyl of Work;'‘ “As It Is in Heaven,’' and
“The Unseen Frie11d.'' Miss Larcom was always the warn] friend of
the working girl. She was born in Beverly‚ Mass, in 1826, and died in
April, 1893.

A STRIP OF BLUE.

DO not own an 111011 of land, Rieher am I than he who owus
Ι But all I 500 15 1111110- Great fleets aud argosies ;
The orehard and the mowing-fields, Ι have a share in every ship
The lawn and gardens fine. VVon by the inland breeze
The wind my tax-collectore are, To loiter 011 yon airy road
They bring me tithes divine— Above the apple-trees.
Wild soenes and subtle essenees, I freight them with my untold dreams,
A tribute rare and free ; Eaeh bears my own picked erew;
And more magnificent than all, And nobler cargoes wait for them
My window keeps for me Thau ever India knew—
A glimpse of blue immensity— My ships that sail into the East
A little strip of sea. Across that outlet blue.
