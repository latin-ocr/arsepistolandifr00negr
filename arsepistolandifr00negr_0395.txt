JAMES MAURmE THOMPsoN.

Author and Naturalist.

Δ HAPPY diversity of talent is that of Mr. Thompson, who was
qualified in 1885 to be chief of the State Geological Survey,
while at the same time he was capable of writing romances
that secured a wide circle of readers. He was a lover of birds
especially, and took high rank as an ornithologist, thus becom-
ing prominent as an author and a naturalist.

Mr. Thompson was born at Fairfield,1ndiana, September 9, 1844.
He was not destined, however, to reside long in his native State at this
time. His parents removed to Kentucky, where they remained for a
short period and then took up their abode in Georgia. As he grew up in
this State, with its strong Southern sentiment, he naturally took sides
with the Confederates and enlisted and fought under their banner. He
returned to lndiana at the end of the war and engaged with a railway
surveying party. Very soon he made his way to the highest position

Mr. Thompson's delight was to visit Florida and in its swamps and
glades to study the habits of the animals and birds. He had a strange
antipathy to the use of the gun, but always took with him his bow and
arrow. In fact, he wrote a book upon archery, and all through his writ-=
ings he makes allusions to these Indian weapons.

Mr. Thompson's writings in various periodicals attracted attention.
His style is clear and incisive, he has a wide command of language, and
his imagination has about it a southern glow quite captivating to the
reader. Having turned his attention toward fiction, he became a suc-
cessful author. Several of his first works received only a moderate
recognition, but some of the later ones, especially “ Alice of Old Vincen-
nes,''v brought him into prominence. In 1875 he published a work
entitled “‘Hoosier Mosaios.'' Afterward appeared quite a number of
volumes‚ among which are, “The Witchery of Archery,'’ “ The Talla-
