PUBLIO HONOR

HERE is no mistake in this case : there
can be none: experienee has already
been the prophet of events, and the

eries of our future victims have already
reached us. The western inhabitants are not
a silent and uncomplaining sacrifice. The
voice of humanity issues from the shade of the
wilderness: it exclaims, that, while one hand
is held up to reject this treaty, the other grasps
a tomahawk. It summons our imagination
to the soenes that will open it and requires no
great effort of the imagination to conceive that
events so near are already begun. I can fancy
that I listen to the yells of savage vengeance
and the shrieks of torture: already they seem
to sigh in the western wind: already they
mingle with every echo from the mountains.

Let me cheer the mind, weary and ready to
despond on this prospect, by presenting
another which it is yet in our power to realize.
Is it possible for a real American to look at
the prosperity of this country, without some
desire for its continuance, without some re-
spect for the measures which many will say
produced, and all will confess have preserved
it? Will he not feel some dread, that a
change of system will reverse the scene?

The well grounded fears of our citizens, in
1794, were removed by the treaty, but are not
forgotten. Then they deemed war nearly in-
evitable, and would not this adjustment have
been considered at that day as a happy escape
from the calamity? The great interest and
the general desire of our people was to enjoy
the advantages of neutrality. This instru-
ment, however misrepresented, affords America
that inestimable security. The causes of oui·

¹ disputes are either cut up by the roots, or re-
l ferred to a new negotiation, after the end of
μ’ the European war.

For, when the fiery vapors of the war low-

are a father—the blood of your sons shall
fatten your cornfield ε you are a mother—the
warwhoop shall wake the sleep of the cradle.

On this subject ye need not suspect any
deception on your feeliugs: it is a spectacle of
horror, which cannot be overdrawn.

AND FIDELITY.

ered in the skirts of our horizon, all our
wishes were concentrated in this one, that we
might escape the desolation of the storm. This
treaty, like a rainbow on the edge of the cloud,
marked to our eyes the space where it was
raging, and afforded at the same time the sure
prognostic of fair weather. If we reject it,
the vivid colors will grow pale, it will be a
baleful meteor portending tempest and war.

Ι rose to speak under impressions that Ι
would have resisted if Ι could. Those who
see me will believe, that the reduced state of
my health has unfitted me, almost equally,
for much exertion of body or mind. Un-
prepared for debate by careful reflection in
my retirement, or by long attention here, Ι
thought the resolution I had taken, to sit
silent, was imposed by necessity, and would
eost me no effort to maintain. With a mind
thus vacant of ideas, and sinking, as Ι really
am, under a sense of weakness‚ I imagined
the very desire of speaking was extinguished
by the persuasion that I had nothing to say.

Yet when Ι come to the moment of decid-
ing the vote, Ι start back with dread from the
edge of the pit into which we are plunging.
In my view, even the minutes I have spent in
expostulation have their value, because they
protect the crisis, and the short period in
which alone we may resolve to escape it.

Ι have thus been led by my feelings to speak
more at length than Ι had intended. Yet Ι
have perhaps as little personal interest in the
event as any one here. There is, Ι believe,
no member, who will not think his chance to
be a witness of the consequence greater than
mine. If the vote should pass to reject, and
a spirit should rise to make “ confusion worse
confounded,'' even Ι, slender and almost
broken as my hold upon life is, may outlive the
government and constitution of my country.
