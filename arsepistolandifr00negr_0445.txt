“ But can’t you whistle it?’' persisted
Whitefoot. “ Ι 0011 whistle almost any tune
I ever heard—whistle some of it, anyhow.''

“ Oh, ye kin, eh? Well, I aint over an’
above slow 011 puckerin’ my lips myself, when
Ι 11001· a good tune on a fiddle or a horn, but
when a hull lot of fiddles an' horns is a-goin'
at a time, besides half a dozen drums an' a
lot of other things that I couldn't tell the
names of, if Ι 11οᾶ to save my life by doin' it—
when all them things plays a tune, why then
I don't try to whistle as much as I might.''

“ Oh, Ι 800. A band played it, eh? ”

“ Well, somewhat. A band, or half a dozen
bands, more like.''

‘⁴ But,'' urged Whitefoot, as he took his
banjo from the wall and began to tune it. “1
reckon you can kind o' get unto the jingle, so
I can give the boys a taste of it.'’

The old man eyed the banjo as contempt-
uously as if it were a man who drove only a
single pair of mules instead of a prairie four-
in-hand; then 110 said :

“ ’Tisn’t the kind of tune that’s got a jingle

to it. You couldn’t play it on no durned
banjo, no how.'’

Whitefoot pocketed the insult, for Brayley
was too old to hit. Then Gloves, a mule-
driver who read books, sometimes talked about
the East, shaved every morning, and was
therefore regarded with some suspicion by his
associates, said:

“ Tell us what you remember about it, Mr.
Brayley, won’t you? ''

“ Well,'’ answered the old man, after several
vigorous suoks at a refractory pipe, “it ain’t
110 easy thing to tell about. F irst, ther'
’peared to be three or four tunes mixed up
together an' not knowin’ which of ’0111 was to
lead the percession. They wasn’t mixed long,
though; all of a sudden they got 11 fair start,
all together, an' 'twas jest bully. Why, it
made me feel as if we wuz a-breakin' camp
for a long prairie trip where the grass wuz
good, with plenty of water along the road.
I’d have give five dollars if I could have got
up on my seat an' cracked a whip an’ 01188οᾶ
0 1111110. 1 felt so good.

“All of a sudden, though, an' jest ez if it
wuz at a fandango, it kinder 'peared ez esther

must be an infernal row goin' on somewheres
an’ fellers thet didn't want to be into the
sorimmage needed to light out mighty lively.
Ι began to think I'd better make tracks my-
self3 then I got afraid a hull corral of mules
Wuz a-goin' to stampede. Ι never wuz such a
fool, fur of course ther wuzn’t no mules
within a thousan' miles of that music. Pooty
soon, though, the fuss all petered out, an’ I
kinder felt ez ef I’d gone through the stable
an' seen that none of my anamiles wuz in
trouble, nor none of the harness stolen, nor
nuthin'-—an' Ι jest tell you that music made
me fell mighty comfortable.

“ But it kept a-goin' on, an' a-goin’ on, an' I
got to almost b’lievin' that Ι was in the quar-
ters here, the mules all fed an’ watered an'
the supper a-cookin'—why, lame my leaders 11
Ι didn't smell the coffee a-steamin', an’ the
pork a fryin’ ez plain ez Ι ever didin my life,
though of course nobody wuz a fixin' grub in
a high-toned, six-mule concern like that music
ranoh wuz. Ι kept a feelin' nicer an' nicer,
an‘ quieter, till at last it seemed time to turn
in—th music ’peared to say so, an' Ι reckon I
<lid turn in, fur after a while a feller wuz a
shakin' me, an' everybody else dug out, an’
the band hed made tracks too, so I harnessed
up an’ lit out myself. But you recollect what
Ι tell you, that tune wuz jest a hull corral of
music.’'

“Can't you remember the name?'' asked
Gloves, the driver from the East, who had
listened with great interest to old Brayley's
story.

“ Durned ef Ι kin,'' was the reply, after a
moment or two of intense thought and head-
scratching. “ But say——I believe I've got the
bill of fare uv it in my pack. Jest waita
minit.’'

The old man arose briskly, rummaged
through his pack‚ and finally extracted a
crumpled programme, which he handed to
Gloves, who regarded it as eagerly and lovingly
as if it was a dear old acquaintance, as he
murmured:

‘⁸ H’m. I might have known it. ‘Beetho-
ven's Pastoral Symphony'—-Theodore Thomas’
Orchestra.'‘
