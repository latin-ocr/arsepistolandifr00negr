JOHN HABBERTON.
Author of “ Helen's Babie5.’'

 

’· ⁴÷ xlJ‘ANCIES—orif you please, fads—sometimes run wild among
· '⁸ Ῐ the reading public, and a work makes what in common par-
‘ ·.. lance is called “a hit,'' which at another time might have a
⁹ cool reception. There comes a craze for the historical nove1;
then for the country story3 next, for the detective‘s harrowing
tale ς and public taste vascillates and may be accounted fickle.

 

When ΜΓ. Habberton issued his story entitled “Helen's Babies‚”
he provided for his readers an amusing and very enjoyable book, and did
it at a time when the public were ready for it. It struck the popular
fancy. T hat work gave him a reputation which he afterward sus-
tained.

John Habberton was born in Brooklyn, N. Y„ February 24, 1842.
He lived in Illinois from his eighth to his seventeenth year, then went to
New York‚ learned to set type in the establishment of Harper & Brothers,
and subsequently entered their counting-room. In 1862 he enlisted in
the army as a private, rose to the rank of first lieutenaut‚ aud served
through the war. He was again in the employ of the Harpers, from 1865
to 1872, when he went into business for himself and failed in six months.
This led him to become a contributor to periodicals, and later to accept
the post of literary editor of the “ Christian Union,'' which he held from
1874 to 1877, when he resigned to take an editorial position on the New
York “ Herald.'' His first literary work was a series of sketches of west-
ern life. His “ Helen’s Babies‚'' after being rejected by three publishers‚
was brought out by a Boston house in 1876, and has sold to the extent of
about three hundred thousand copies in the United States. Eleven

different English editions of it have appeared, besides several in the
Eritish colonies, and it has been translated into French, German and
ltalian.

A few of Mr. Habberton's other works are “ The Barton Experiment,’'
“ The Jericho Road‚'' “The Scripture Club of Valley Rest,'' “Other
People‘s Children‚'’ “ The Crew of the Samuel wellen* ‘⁸ The Worst Boy
