CONCORD HYMN.
SUNG AT THE COMPLETION OF THE CONCORD MONUMENT.

Y the rude bridge that arched the flood,
Their flag to April’s breeze unfurled,

Here once the embattled farmers stood,
And fired the shot heard round the world,

The foe long since in silence slept ;
Alike the conqueror silent sleeps 3
And time the ruined bridge has swept
Down the dark stream which seaward creeps.

On this green bank, by this soft stream,
We set to-day a votive stone ;

That· memory may their deed redeem,
When, like our sires, our sons are gone.

Spirit, that made those heroes dare

To die, and leave their children free,
Bid time and nature gently spare

The shaft we raise to them and thee.

SELF-RELIANOE.

NSIST on yourself; never imitate. Your Franklin, or Washington, οι· Bacon, 01·
own gift you can present every moment Newton?

with the cumulative force of a whole life’s
cultivation; but of the adopted talent of
another you have only an extemporaneeus, half
possession. That which each cando best, none
but his Maker can teach him. No man yet
knows what it is, nor can till that person has
exhibited it. Where is the master who
could have taught Shakespeare? Where
is the master who could have instructed

Every great man is a unique. The Scipi-
onism of Scipio is precisely that part he could
not borrow. If anybody would tell me whom
the great man imitates in the original crisis
when he performs a great act, I will tell him who
else than himself can teach him. Shakespeare
will never be made by the study of Shakes-
peare. Do that which is assigned thee, and
thou canst not hope too much 01· dare too much.

BEAUTY OF HEROIG DEEDS.

HE high and divine beauty' which can be
loved without effeminacy‚ is that which
is found in combination with the human

will, and never separate. Beauty is the mark
God sets upon virtue. Every natural action
is graceful. Every heroic act is also decent,

and causes the place and the bystanders to ᾗ

shine. We are taught by great actions that
the universe is the property of every individ-
ual in it. Every rational creature has all
nature for his dowry and estate. It is his, if
he will. He may divest himself of it; he may
creep into a corner, and abdicate his kingdom,
as most men do; but he is entitled to the
world by his constitution. In proportion to
the energy of his thought and will, he takes
up the world into himself.

“All those things for which men plough,
huild or sail‚ obey virtue;'' said an ancient
historiali.

 

 

“The winds and waves‚’' said Gib- Δ

bon, “are always on the side of the ablest
navigators.'' So are the sun and moon and
all the stars of heaven. When a noble act is

Ἰ done—perchance in a scene of great natural

beauty; when Leonidas and his three hundred

martyrs consume one day in dying, and the

sun and moon come each and look at them
once in the steep defile of Thermopylae; when
Arnold Winkelried‚ in the high Alps, under
the shadow of the avalanche, gathers in his
side a sheaf of Austrian spears to break the
line for his comrades; are not these heroes
entitled to add the beauty of the scene to the
beauty of the deed?

When the bark of Columbus nears the
shore of America—-before it, the beach lined
with savages, fleeing out of all their huts of
cane; the sea behind; and the purple moun-
tains of the Indian Archipelago around, can
we separate the man from the living picture?
