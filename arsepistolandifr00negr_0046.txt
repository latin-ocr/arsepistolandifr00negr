¹ Tears came into his eyes; and as slowly he

Vanished the vision away, but Evangeline
knelt at 1113 116(131(16.

bosom.

and the sorrow,

RESIGNATION.

The tender sympathy‚ deep pathos, aud lofty saith breathing through this exquisite poem,
are quite characteristic of the sweet 61ιά noble singer who wrote it. It has the highest of all

merit -it is a poem of the 116611.

H ERE is no flock, however watched 61ιά
Β111 0116 (166(1 1611111 13 there! [te11ded,

There 13 110 fireside howsoe'er defended,
But has one vacant 6116111

The air 13 full of farewells to the dying ;
And mournings for the dead ;

The heart of Rachel, for her children crying,
Will not be comforted 1

Let us be patient! These severe afflictions
Not from the ground arise,

But oftentimes celestial benedictions
Assume this dark disguise.

We see but dimly through the mists and vapors ;
Amid these earthly damps

What seem to us but sad, funeral tapers
May be heaven’s distant lamps.

There is 110 death 1 What seems so 13 transition
This life of mortal breath

Is but 6 suburb of the life elysiam
Whose portal we call Death.

She is not dead—the child of our affection—

But gone unto that school

W here she 110 longer needs our poor protection,

And Christ himself doth rule.

In that great cloister's 3111111633 and seclusion,

By guardian 6118613 led,

Safe from temptation, safe from sin‘s pollution,

She lives whom we 6611 dead.
