ALFRED TENNYSON. 471

Ι chatter, chatter, as Ι flow
To join the brimming river;

For men may come and men may go,
But I go on for ever.

Ι wind about, and in and out,
With here a blosssom sailing,
And here and there a lusty trout,

And here and there a grayling;

And here and there a foamy flake
Upon me, as I travel,

With many a silvery waterhreak
Above the golden gravel ;

And draw them all along, and flow
To join the brimming river;

For men may come and men may go,
But Ι go on for ever.

I steal by lawns and grassy plots3
Ι slide by hazel covers ;

Ι move the sweet forget-me-nots
That grow for happy lovers.

Ι slip, I slide, I gloom, Ι glauce,
Among my skimniing swallows3

Ι make the netted sunbeam dance
Against my sandy shallows.

I murmur under moon and stars
In brambly wildernesscs3

I linger by my shingly bars3
Ι loiter round my cresses;

And out again I curve and fiow
To join the briinming river3

For men may come and men may go,
But Ι go on for ever.

THE SPLENDOR FALLS.

HE splendor falls on castle walls,
And snowy summits old in story:

The long light shakes across the lakes,

And the wild cataract leaps in glory.

Blow‚ bugle, blow ; set the wild echoes flying ;
Blow, bugle ; answer, echoes, dying, dying,

dying.

O hark, O hear! how thin and clear,
And thinner‚ clearer, further going ;

O sweet aud far from cliff and scar
The horns of Elfland faintly blowingl

Blow, let ns hear the purple glens replying;
Blow, bugle3 answer‚ colmes, dying, dying,

dying.

O love! they die on yon rich sky ;

They faint on hill, or field, οι· river;

Our cchocs roll from soul to soul,

And grow forever and forever.

Blow, bugle‚ blow; set the wild echoes

flying;

And answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying,

dying.

THE: FINAL GOAL.

YET we trust that somehow good
Will be the final goal of ill,
To pangs of nature, sins of will,
Defects of doubt, and taints of blood ;

That nothing walks with aimless feet;
That not one life shall be destroyed,
Or cast as rubbish to the void,

When God hath made the pile complete;

That not a worm is cloven in vain ;
That not a moth with vain desire

Is shrivellcd in a fruitless fire,
Or but snbserves another's gain.

Behold, we know not anything;
I can but trust that good shall fall
At last—far off——at last, to all,
And every winter change to spring.

So runs my dream : but what am I?
An infant crying in the night :
An infant crying for the light:

And with no language but a cry.
