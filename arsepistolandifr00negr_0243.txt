JAMES THOMAs F1ELDS. 1115

The watch on deck would now and then
Run down and wake him, with the lead3
He'd up, and taste‚ and tell the men
How many miles they went ahead.

One night ’twas J otham Marden’s watch.
A curious wag,———the pcdlar’s son ;

And so he mused (the wanton wretch 1)
“ To-night I’ll have a grain of fun.

“ We're all a set of stupid fooIs,
To think the skipper knows, by tasting,
that ground he's 011 3 Nan tncket schools

Don't teach such stuff, with all their bast-

ing 1 ”

And so he took the well-greased lead,

And rubbed it o’er a box of earth

That stood on deck—a parsnip bed,

And then 110 sought the skipper’s berth.

“ Where arc we now, sir? Please to taste.’'

The skipper yawned, put out his tongue,

And opened his eyes in wondrous haste,

And 111011 upon the floor he sprung !

The skipper stormecl‚ and tore his hair,

Thrust 011 1113 110013, 311(1 roared to Marden,

“ Nantucket’s sunk, and here we are

Right over old Marm Hackett’s garden 1 ”

THE TEMPEST.

E were crowded in the cabin

Not a soul would dare to sheep,—

It was midnight 011 1110 waters
And a storm was on the deep.

'Tis a fearful thing in winter
To be shattered by the blast,
And to hear the rattling trumpet
Thunder, “ Cut away the mast! ''

So we shuddered there in silence,—
For the stoutest held his breath,
While the hungry sea was roaring,

And the breakers talked with Death.

As thus we sat iu darkness,
Each one busy 111 1113 prayers,

“ We are lost! '‘ the captain shouted
As 110 staggered down the stairs.

But his little daughter whispered,
As 3110 took his icy hand,

“ Isn’t God upon the ocean
Just the same 33 011 1110 land? ''

Then we kissed the little maiden,
And we spoke in better cheer,

And we anchored safe in harbor
When the 1110111 was shining clear.

 

ROVER’S PETITION.

LAST POEM OF THE AUTHOR.

C ί IN D tremeler, do not pass me by,
And thus a poor old dog forsake ;

But stop a moment on your way,
And hear my woe, for pity's sake!

“ My name is Rover ; yonder house
Was once my home for many a yea1·;
My master loved me; every hand
Caressed young Rover, far and near.

“The children rode upon my back,

And Ι 00111(1 11031 my praises sung;
With joy I licked their pretty feet,
As round my shaggy sides they clung.

“ I watched them while they played or slept3

I gave them all Ι had to give;

My strength was theirs from 1110111 1111 night ς
For only them I cared to live.
