THE TURKS ROUTED AT VELESTINO.

HERE is a round hill to the north of the
T town, standing quite alone. It has a
perfectly flat top, and its proportions
are exactly those of a giant bucket set upside
down. We found the upper end of this bucket
crowded with six mountain guns, and the bat-
tery was protesting violently. When it had
uttered its protest the guns would throw them-
selves into the air, and would turn a complete
somersault‚ as though with delight at the niis-
chief they had done, or would whirl them-
selves upon one wheel while the other spun
rapidly in the air.

Lieutenant Ambroise Frantzis was in com-
mand of the battery. It was he who had 16-
pulsed a Turkish cavalry charge of afew days
before with this same battery, and he was as
polite and calm and pleased with his excitable
little guns as though they weighed a hundred
tons each, and could send a shell nine miles
instead of a scant three thousand yards.

From this hill there was nothing to be seen
of the Turks but puffs of smoke in the plain,
so we slid down its steep side and clambered
up the ridges in front of us, where long rows
of infantry were outlined against the sky. A
bare-headed peasant boy, in dirty white petti-
coats, who seemed to consider the engagement
in the light of an entertainment, came danc-
ing down the hill to show us the foot-paths
that led up the different ridges. He was one
of the villagers who had not run away or who
was not farther up the valley, taking pot-shots
at the hated Turks from behind rocks. He
talked and laughed as he ran ahead of us,
with many gestures, and imitated mockingly
the sound of the bullets, and warned us with

grave solicitude to be eareful, as though he
was in no possible danger himself.

I saw him a great many times during the
day, guiding company after company through
the gulleys, and showing them how to advance
protected by the slope of the hilis—a self-con-
stituted scout—and with much the manner of
a lauded proprietor escorting visitors over his
estate. And whenever a shell struck near
him, he would run and retrieve the pieces,
and lay them triumphantly at the feet of the
officers, like a little fox-terrier that has scamp—
ered after a stick and brought it to his mas-
ter’s feet.

The men in the first trench-which was the
only one which gave us a clear view of the
Turkish forces—received us with cheerful nods
and scraped out a place beside them, and cov-
ered the moist earth with their blankets. They
exhibited a sort of childish pride and satisfac-
tion at being under fire; and so far from show·
ing the nervousness and shattered morals
which had been prophesied for them after the
rout at Larissa, they appeared on the contrary
more than content.

As the day wore on, they became even lan-
guidly bored with it all, and some sang in a
low crooning tone, and others, in spite of the
incessant rush of the shells, dozed in the full
glare of the sun, and still others lay humped
and crouched against the earthworks when
the projectiles tore up the earth on the hill
behind us. But when the order came to fire,
they would scramble to their knees with alac-
rity, and many of them would continue firing
on their own account, long after the whistle
had sounded to cease firing. Some of the offi-
