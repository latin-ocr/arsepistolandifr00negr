There was stillnaes on the pillow-and the old ,

111811 listened lonely—
Till they led him from the chamber, with the
burden 011 his breast,
For the wife of seventy years, his manhood’s
early love and only,
Lay at rest.

“ Fare-you-well‚’' he sobbed, “ sarah ; you will
meet the babes before me ;
’Tis 11 little while, for neither can the parting
long abido,
And you’ll ceme and call me soon, I know—
and Heaveu will restore me
To your side.’'

It was even so. The spring-time in the steps
Scarcely shed its orchard blossoms ere the old
man closed his eyes,
And they buried him by Sarah--and they had
their “ diamond wedding ’'
In the skies.

WHEN I WEN'I' FISHING WI'I'H DAD.
ΒΥ MARY E. VANDYNE.

HEN I was a boy-—I’m an 0111 111811 now;
Look 111 1110 lines across my brow ;
Old Time has furrowed them there.

We would wander about for 8 little space
To find the cosiest, shadiest place,
Before we went to work.

My back is bent and my eyes are dim; Then dad would arrange his rod and line,

He 11115 placed his finger on every limb,
And pulled out most of my hair.
But if life has reached December,
Ι’111 1101 too old 10 remember
then Ι went fishing with dad.

And tell 1110 just how to manage mine
then the fish began to jerk.
{f I only could feel as Ι used to then!

If the days could only come back again,
'When I went fishing with dad.

We would each of 115 511011111οι- his part of the ive armed our books with the wriggling hait,

101111,
And joyfully start along the road—
But dad‘s was the heaviest share.
Out of the village about a mile,
Over a meadow‚ acroae a stile,
And then we were almost there.
Dear old brook, I can see it still,
The mossy bank and the old gray mill,

there I went fishing with dad.

Then seated ourselves on the bank to wait
And see if the fish would bite.
Sometimes they would only take 8 look,
As if they thought there might be 8 hook,
But couldn't be certain quite.
There was one old perch that 1 used to
think
Would always look at the line and wink.
When I went fishing with dad.
