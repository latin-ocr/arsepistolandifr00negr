impatient of speech. Their souls were on fire for action.''

In the Virginia Convention of 1788 Mr. Henry opposed the adoption
of the F ederal Constitution. He said it had “ an awful squinting toward
monarchy.'’ Monarchy had no name or place in his plan for national
government; he was the bitter foe of the “ gew-gaws that bedeck a king.''
He was a devout believer in Christianity‚ but was not a member of any
religious denomination.

RESISTANGE ΤΟ BRI'I'ISH AGGRESSION.

R. PRESIDENT, itis natural to man to
indulge in the illusions of Hope. We
are apt to shut our eyes against a
painful truth‚ and listen to the song of
that siren, till she transforms us into
beastS. Is this the part of wise men,
engaged in a great and arduous struggle
for liberty? Are we disposed to be of the
number of those who, having eyes see not,
and having ears, hear not, the things which
so ¹nearly concern our tempora] salvation‘?
For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it
may cost, I am willing to know the whole
truth,—-t0 know the worst, and to provide
for it!

Ι 116176 but one lamp, by which my feet are
guided; and that is the lamp of experience.
Ι know of no way of judging of the future
but by the past. And, judging by the past,
I wish to know what there has been in the
conduct of the British ministry, for the last
ten years, to justify those hopes with which
gentlemen have been pleased to solace them-
selves and the House? Is it that insidious
6111116 with which our petition has been lately
received? Trust it not, sir; it will prove a
snare to your feet! Suffer not yourselves to
be betrayed with a kiss! Ask yourselves
how this gracious reception of our petition
. comports with those warlike preparations
which cover our waters and darken our land.
Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of
10176 and reconciliation‘? Have we shown
’ 0016611766 60 unwilling to be reconciled, that
force must be called in to win back our love?

Let us not deceive ourselves‚ sir. These
are the implements of war and subjugation,—
the last arguments to which kings resort. I
ask gentlemen, 811, what means this martial
array, if its purpose be not to force us to sub-
mission? Can gentlemen assign any other
possible motive for it? Has Great Britain
any enemy in this quarter of the world, to call
for all this accumulation of navies and armies?
No, sir, she has none. They are meant for
06; they can be meant for no other. They
are sent over to bind aud rivet upon us those
chains which the British ministry have been
so long forging. And what have we to
oppose to them ‘?—Shall we try argument?
811, we have been trying that, for the last ten
years. Have we anything new to offer upon
the subject? Nothing. We have held the
subject up in every light of which it is capa-
ble; but it has been all in vain.

811611 we resort to entreaty and humble
supplication‘? What terms shall we find
which have not already been exhausted ἶ) Let
us not, Ι beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves
longer. 811, we have done everything that
could 116 done, to avert the storm which is
now coming on. We have petitioned‚ we
have remonstrated, we have suppIicated, we
have prostrated ourselves before the Throne,
and have implored its interposition to arrest
the tyrannical hands of the Ministry and
Parlia ment. Our petitions have heen slighted,
our remonstrances have produced additional
violence and insuit, our supplications have
been disregarded, and we have been
