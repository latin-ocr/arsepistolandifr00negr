Although she has lived abroad a great deal, she never lost her love
for her native land. She was one of the first women who essayed the

onerous task of correspondent at Washington‚ where much of her time
has been spent. During our Civil NVar she was a warm friend of the
'soldiers‚ and by reading and giving lectures in camps and hospitals
endeared herself to thousands who have since cherished her memory.
President Lincoln was accustomed to speak of her as ‘⁴ Grace Greenwood.

BABY FLORENOE} IN ΗΕΒ BATH—TUB.
FROM “RECORDS OF FIVE YEARs.”

coPYRmH’r, Houen’ron, mmmm ἀ co.

T is the first morning of the eldest married
sister's first visit home, with her first
baby ; and the first baby, having slept

late after its journey, is about to take its first
bath in the old house.

‘¹ well, Ι (leclare, if here isn't mother, for-
getting her dairy, and cousin N ellie, too, who
must have left poor Ned all to himself in the
garden, lonely and disconsolate, and I am
torn from my books, and Sophie from her
flowers, and all for the sake of seeing a nine-
month-old baby kicking about in a bath-tub!
What simpletons we are 1 ''

Thus Miss Annie, the proude layde of the
family ; handsome, haughty, with perilous pro-

clivities toward grand socialistic theories,

transcendentalism, and general strong-mind-
cdness; pledged by many a saucy vow to a
life of single dignity and freedom, given to
studies artistic, {esthetim philosophie and ethi-
cal; a student of Plato, an absorber of Emer-
son, and exalter of her seX, a contemnet of its
natural enemies.

“Simpletons, are we?'’ eries pretty Elinor
Lee, aunt of the baby on the other side, and
“ Cousin Nellie’' by love's courtesy, now kneel-
ing close by the bath-tub, and receivingon her

‘Crouching Venus?' and this is a sight a
thousand times more beautiful; for here we
have color, action, radiant life, and such grace
as the divinest sculptors of Greece were never
able to entrance in marble. Just look at
these white, dimpled shoulders‚ every dimple
holding a tiny, sparkling drop—these rosy,
plashing feet and hands—this laughin g, roguish
face—these eyes, bright and blue and deep as
lakes of fairy-land—these ears like dainty
sea-shells —these locks of gold, dripping
diamonds—and tell me what cherub of Titian,
what Cupid of Greuze, was ever half so lovely.
I say, too, that Raphael himself would have
jumped at the chance of painting Louise, as
she sits there, towel in hand, in all the serene
pride and chastened dignity of young mater-
nity—of painting her as Madomzass'

“Why‚ Cousin Nellie is getting poetical for
once, over a baby in a bath—tub Ι ”

“Well Sophie, isn’t it a subject to inspire
real poets, to call out and yet humble the
genius of painters and sculptors? Isn’t it an
object for the reverence of ‘ a glorious human

creature '—such a pure and perfect form of
physical life, such a starry little soul, fresh
from the hands of God? If your Plato

sunny braids a liberal baptism from the pure, teaches otherwise, Cousin Annie, I’m glad
plashing hands of babyhood—“simplet0ns‚ I’ve no acquaintance with that distinguished
indeed! Did I not once see thee, Ο Pallas, heathen gentleman; if your Carlyle, with his
Athene, standing rapt before a copy of the ‘soul above buttons' and babies‚ would growl,
