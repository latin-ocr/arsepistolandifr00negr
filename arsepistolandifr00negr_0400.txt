WAsfflNoToN ALLsToN.
Renowned Author and Artist.

   

ᾔῨ-ςῖἳΟΝΙ every point of view Mr. Allston was eminent, and 111 some
&affl respects our country can boast no name entitled to greater ad-
ψ») §fij miration. Although he was most distinguished as an artist,
543& his place in literature is an honored one. He would be more
Q lauded as an author but for his exalted rank in the world of

art, his great achievements with the painter's brush over-
shadowing the productioris of his pen. Yet he has made his own place

in our distinctive literature.
He was enthralled by his own art. His grand conceptions on canvas

outstripped his power to execute and place them before the world's
admiring eye. Yet as no account of American art would be complete
without a description of his peerless masterpieces‚ so any treatise on our
literature would be deficient without the mention of those finished wri-
tings which have conferred upon him lasting fame.

Griswold says: “Although Mr. Allston owed his chief celebrity to
his paintings‚ which will preserve for his name a place in the list of the
greatest artists of all the nations and ageS‚ his literary works alone would
have given him a high rank among men of genius.

“ ‘The Sylphs of the Seasons‚' his longest poem, in which he
describes the scenery of Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter‚ and the
effects of each season on the mind, show that, he regarded nature with a
curious eye, and had power to exhibit her beauties with wonderful dis-
tinctness and fidelity. ‘The Two Painters’ is an admirable satire, in-
tended to ridicule attempts to reach perfectiori in one excellency in the
art of painting‚ to the neglect of every other. Nearly all his minor
poenis are strikingly original and beautiful.''

Mr. Allston was the author of “ Monaldi‚’' a story of extraordinary
power and interest, in which he displays a deep sensibility to beauty‚ and
philosophie knowledge of human passion.

Mr. Allston was born in South Carolina‚ of a family which has con-

tributed some eminent names to our annals, though none that sheds more
