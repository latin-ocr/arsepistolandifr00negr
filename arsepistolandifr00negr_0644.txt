Far in the bosom of Helvellyn,
Remote from public road or dwelling,
Pathway‚ or cultivated land,—

From trace of human foot or hand.

There sometimes doth a leaping fish
Send through the tarn a lonely cheer ς
The crags repeat the raven’s croak

In symphony austere;

Thither the rainbow comes, the cloud,
And mists that spread the flying shroud ;
And sunbeams; and the sounding blast,
That, if it could, would hurry past,

But that enormous barrier holds it fast.

Not free from boding thoughts, awhile
The shepherd stood ; then makes his way
O'er rocks and stones, following the dog
As quickly as he may ;

N or far had gone before he found

A human skeleton on the ground.

The appalled discoverer with a sigh
Looks round to learn the history.

From those abrupt and perilous rocks
The man had fallen, that place of fear!

WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.

At length upon the shepherd’s mind
It breaks, and all is clear.
He instantly recalled the name,

ἰ·

And who he was, and whence he came ; l
Remembered, too, the very day ¹
On which the traveller passed this way. 1
l

But hear a wonder, for whose sake

This lamentable tale I tell l

A lasting monument of words

This wonder merits well.

The dog, which still was hovering mgb,

Repeating the same timid cry,

This dog had been through three months’
space

A dweller in that savage place.

Yes, proof was plain, that, since the day
then this ill-fated traveller died,

The dog had watched about the spot,

Or by his master's side.

How nourished here through such long time
He knows who gave that love sublime.
And gave that strength of feeling, great

,Above all human estimate !

ODE ΟΝ IMMORTALITY.

UR birth is but a sleep and a foigetting:
The soul that risos with us our life’s
star,
Hath had elsewhere its setting,
And cometh from afar;
Not in entire forgetfulness,
And not in utter nakedness‚
But, trailing clouds of glory, (lo we come
From God, who is our home:
Heaven lies about us in our infancy !
Shades of the prison-house begin to close
Upon the growing boy,
But he beholds the light, and whence it flows,
He sees it in his j0y;
The youth, who daily sarther from the East
Must travel, still is nature's priest,
And by the vision splendid
Is on his way attended ;
At length the man perceives it die away,
And fade into the light of common day.

 

Ean-th fills her lap with pleasures of her own ;
Yearnings she hath in her natural kind;
And, even with something of a mother's mind,
And no unworthy aim,
The homely nurse doth all she can
To make her foster-child, her inmate man,
Forget the glories he hath known
And that imperial palace whence he came.

The thought of our past years in me doth breed
Perpetual benedictions: not indeed
For that which is most worthy to be blest3
Delight and liberty, the simple creed
Of childhood, whether busy or at rest,
With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his
breast—
Not for these Ι raise

The songs of thanks and praise ;

But for those obstinate questionings

Of sense and outward things,
