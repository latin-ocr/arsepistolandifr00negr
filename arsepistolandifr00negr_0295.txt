'I'OUSSAIN T L'OUVERTURE.

Toussaint L'Ouverture, who has been pronounced one of the renowned statesmen and
generals of the nineteenth century, saved his master and family by hurrying them on board
a vessel at the insurrection of the negroes of Hayti. He then joined the negro army, and
soon found himself at their head. N apoleon sent a fleet with French veterans, with orders
to bring him to Fra nce at all hazzards. But all the skill of the French soldiers could not
subdue the negro army; and they finally made a treaty, placing Toussaint L’Ouverture
governor of the island. The negroes no sooner disbanded their army, than a squad of
soldiers seized Toussaint by night, and taking him on board a vessel hurried him to France.

There he was placed in a dunge0n‚ and finally starved to death.

F Ι were to tell you the story of Napoleon‚

I should take it from the lips of French-
men, who find no language rich enough

to paint the great captain of the nineteenth
century. Were Ι to tell you the story of Wash-
ington, I should take it from your hearts—you,
who think no marble white enough on which
to carve the name of the Father of this coun-
try. But Ι am to tell you the story of a negro,
Toussaint L'Ouverture, who has left hardly
one written line. Ι am to glean it from the
reluctant testimony of his enemies, men who
despised him because he was a negro and a
slave, hated him because he had beaten them

in battle.
Cromwell manufactured his own army. Na-

poleon‚ at the age of twenty-seven, was placed
at the head of the best troops Europe ever saw.
Cromwell never saw an army till he was forty ;
this man never saw a soldier till he was fifty.
Cromwell manufactured his own army—out of
what? Englishmen—the best blood in Europe.
Out of the middle class of Englishmen—-the
hest blood of the island. And with it he con-
quered what? Englishmen—their equals.
This man manufactured his army out of what?
Out of what you call the despicable race of
negroes, debased, demoralized by two hun-
dred years of slavery, one hundred thousand
of them imported into the island within four
years, unable to speak a dialect intelligible

 

even to each other. Yet out of this mixed,
and, as you say, despicable mass he forged a
thunderbolt and hurled it at what? At the
proudest blood in Europe, the Spaniard, and
sent him home conquered ; at the most war-
like blood in Europe, the French, and put
them under his feet; at the pluckiest blood in
Europe, the English, and they skulked home
to J amaica.

Now, blue-eyed saxon, proud of your race,
go back with me to the commencement of the
century, and select what statesman you please.
Let him be either American or European;
crown his temples with the silver locks of
seventy years and show me the man of Saxon
lineage for whom his most sanguine admirer
will wreathe a laurel, rich as embittered foes
have placed on the brow of this inspired black
of St. Domingo.

Some doubt the courage of the negro. Go
to Hayti, and stand on those fifty thousand
graves of the best soldiers France ever had,
and ask them what they think of the negro's

swfrgould call him N apoleon‚ but Napoleon

made his way to empire over broken oaths and
through a sea of blood. This man never
broke his word. I would call him Cromwell,
but Gromwell was only a soldier, and the state
he founded went down with him into his grave.
I would call him Washington‚ but the great
