Y the flow of the inland river, Under the sod and the dew,
XVhence the fleets of iron have fied, waiting the judgment day 3

WVhere the blades of grave-grass quiver, Under the laurel‚ the Blue,
Asleep on the ranks of the dead 2— Under the willow, the Gray.

Under the sod and the dew,
Waiting the judgment day ;

Under the one, the Blue,
Under the other, the Gray.

From the silence of sorrowful hours,
The desolate mourners go,
Lovin gl y laden with fiowers,
Alike for the friend and the foe :—
These in the robings of glory, Under the sod and the dew,
Those in the gloom of defeat, Waiting the judgment day3
All with the battle-blood gory, Under the roses, the Blue‚
In the dusk of eternity meet :-— Under the lilies, the Gray.
