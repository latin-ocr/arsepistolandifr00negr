WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.

It was on a Thanksgiving Day in Plymouth

Church, Brooklyn‚ whose pastor was then at the height of his remarkable 1³

career·

The November snow was flying outside, but the building was
crowded to its utinost capacity. ΜΓ. Bryant was unable to obtain a seat,
but made his way to the gallery, where he stood during the service with ;

1115 back to the wall, the “observed of all observers.'‘ His head was ’
partially bald, his long locks rested on his broad shoulders, his beard was
heavy and white, and with it all there was the 111-6 of genius in his eye.
and a benign expression of conntenance indicating clearly the traits of ”

the inan.

Very few men of letters in any country have been so highly

AMER-IOAN SKIES.

THE sunny Italy may boast
The beauteons tints that flush her

skies‚
And lover, round the Grecian coast,

May thy blne pillars rise:
I only know how fair they stand
About my own beloved land.

And they are fair: a charm is theirs,
That earth-the prond, green earth—has

not

 

With all the hues, and forms, and airs,
That haunt her sweetest spot.

ch gaze 1111011 thy calm, pure sphere,

And read of heaven's eternal year,

Oh! when, aniid the throng of men,
The heart grows sick ofhollow mirth,
How willingly we turn us then,
Away from this cold 6111111,
And look into thy azure hreast,
For seats of 111110661166 and rest.

ERRILY swlngIng on brier and rced,

Hidden among the summer flowers.

Robert of Lineoln’s Quaker wife,
Pretty and quiet, with plain brown wingS,
Passing at home a patient life,
Broods in the grass while her husband sings:

Brood, kind creature: you need not fem·
Thieves and robbers while I am here.
