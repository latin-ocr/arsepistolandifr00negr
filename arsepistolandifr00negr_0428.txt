light; a deep silence pervaded the air and
was emphasim-d, at inm-vals, rather than
broken, by the liooting 01’ an owl, the baying
of a dog, 01· the mnflled crash of a caving
bank in the distance.

The little company assembled on 1110 108
were all children, (at least in simplicity :ind
broad and co1nprel1ensive ignorance) and 1110

“(Jliil'e11, dalis 3111111111 a eolnin’ !''

All crowded close together and every beart
beat fastor. Uncle Dan'l pointed down the
river with his bony finger.

A deep 0008111118 sound troubled the still-
ncss, way toward a wooded cape that jutted
into the stream a 111110 distant, All in an in-
stant a 110Γο0 eye of fire shot out froin behind
the cape and sent along brilliant pathway
quivering nthwart the dusky water. The
coughing grew londer and louder, the glaring
eye grew larger and still larger, glared wilder
and still wilder.

A 11080 shape developed itself out of the
8100111, and froin its tall duplicate horns dense

sparks, 110111·οἀ ont and went tuxnbling away
into the farther darkness. Nearer and nearer
the thing came, till its long sides began to
glow with spots of light which mirrored thein-
selves in the river and attendcd the monster
like a torclilight procession.

‘⁶ that isit! Oh, what is it, Uncle Dan'l!’'

With deep solemnity the answer came :

“ It's de Almighty! Git down on yo'
knees! ’'

It was not necessary to say it twice. They
were all kneeling, in a moment. And then
while the mysterious coughing rose stronger
and stronger and the threatening glare reached

further and wider, the negro’s voice lifted up
its supplicatione:

CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER.

“ O Lord, we's ben mighty wicked, an’ we
knows dat we ’zerve to go to dc bad place, but
good Lord, deah Lord, we aiut ready yet, we
aiut ready—let dese po’ chil'en hab one mo'
chance, jes' 0110 100’ chance. Take de 010

The flaming and churning steamer was
right abreast the party, and not twenty steps
away. The awful thunder of a mud-valve
suddenly burst forth, drowning the prayer,
and as suddenly Uncle Dan’l snatched a child
under each arm and scoured into the woods
with the rest of the pack athis heels. And
then, ashamed of himself, he halted iu the

110οὲ11 darkness and shouted (but rather
ee y):

“ Heah 1 is, Lord, heah I is! '⁹
There was a moment of throbbing suspense,
and then, to the surprise and comfort of the

party, it was plain that the august presence
had gone by, forits dreadful noises were re-

ceding. Uncle Dau'l headed a cautious
reconnoissanoe in the direction of the 108.
Sure enough ‘⁴ the Lord '' was just turning a
point a short distance up the river, and while

they looked, the lights winked out and the

coughing diminished by degrees and presently
ceased altogether.
