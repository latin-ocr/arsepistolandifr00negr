ROBERT JONES BURDETTE.

“Could Ι but climb where Moses stood ”——but
the half of them wouldn't climb ;

They'd pile in the wagon full’s 'twould hold
an' ride up every time ;

If they had to walk they'd do's they did when
your pastern joint was sprained—

They'd say 'twas too far, an' stay at home,
like they did the times it rained.

I'm going to write a hymn’some day, an' we'll
sing it out in the sheds—

“ Welcome‚ delightful morn that pours the
rain upon our heads ;

Welcome the slush, the snow that drifts, the
mud that irritates,

The storms that bring a Sabbath rest to the

cattle within the gates.'’

His voice was hushed, for the notes of song

rose on the hallowed air—
“ Praise God from whom all blessings flow ''—

thanksgiving, praise and prayer3

“Praise Him all creatures here below ''—
man, beast, an’ bird an’ thing—

With the possible exception of the farmer's
wife, who, having remained at home to
prepare a dinner of chicken soup‚ roast
beef, beets, onions, roasting ears, salad,
pudding‚ two kinds of pie and fruit for
her husband, three sons, four daughters
the pastor, his wife and two children, the
district secretary of the Home Mission
Society‚ a distant relative from the city
come out to spend the day, and two hired
men, had very little time, and not much
breath‚ and possibly not an everlastingly
superabundant inclination to sing.

ALONE.

To appreciate “Alone,'' the reader should remember that Mr. Burdette is popular as a
humorist. The sickness of his wife called him to her bedside for many long weeks-—she

finally died, and “Alone '' expresses his loss.

MISS you, my darling, my darling,
l The embers flurn low on the hearth 3
And still is the stir of the household‚
And hushed is the voice of its mirth ;
The rain splashes fast on the terrace,
The wind past the lattices moan ;
The midnight chimes out from the minster,
And I am alone.

Ι want you, my darling, my darling,
I am tired with care and with fret3

Ι would nestle in silence beside you,
And all but your presence forget.

In the hush of the happiness given,

To those who through trusting have grown
To the fullness of love in contentment,

But Ι am alone.

Ι call you, my darling, my darling,
My voice echoes back on my heart:

1 stretch my arms to you in longing,
And lo 1 they fall empty apart,

I whisper the sweet words you taught me,
The words that we only have known,

Till the blank of the (lumb air is bitter,

For I am alone.

I need you, my darling, my darling,
With its yearning my very heart aches3
The load that divides us Weighs harder,
I shrink from the jar that it makes.
Old sorrows rise up to besct me,
Old doubts make my spirit their own,
Oh, come through the darkness and save me;
For I am alone.
