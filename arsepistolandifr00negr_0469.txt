FAVORITE POEMS AND PROSE SELECTIONS. 421

Each shore to thy glory its tribute unfold‚ Thus, as down a 10116 valley, with cedars o'er-
And the east and the south yield their spices spread,
and gold· From war‘sd dread confusion, Ι pensively
straye ‚—

As the dayspring unbounded thy splendor . ·
shall flow' The gloom from the face offan· heaven ret11·ed;

The winds ceased to murmur, the thunders

And earth’s little kingdoms before thee shall expired ;

, bOW' , , , , Perfumes, as of Eden, flowed sweetly along,
While the enslgns of unlon, 111 trlumph un· And a voice, as Ofangels' enchamingly sung:
furled· “ Columbia, Columbia, to glory arise,
Hush tl? tumfflt of war> and give peace to The queen 0f the world,an<11he child of the
t e wor . skies.”

 

ΗΔΕ, GOLUMBIA.
ΒΥ JOSEPH HOPKINsoN.

The following account of the circumstances attending the composition of this song was
communicated by the author a few months before his death. ‘⁴ It was written in the summer
of 1798, when war with F rance was thought to be inevitable. Congress was then in session
in Philadelphia‚ deliberating upon that important subject, and acts of hostility had actually
taken place. The contest between England und France was raging. The violation of our
rights by both belligerents was forcing us from the just and wise policy of President WASH-
1NGTON, which was to do equal justice to both. to take part with neither, but to preserve a
strict and honest neutrality between them.

“The violence of the spirit of party has never risen higher, I think, in our country, than
it did at that time. The theatre was then open in the city. A young man belonging to it,
whose talent was as a singer, was about to take his bene-fit. Ι had known him when 116 was
at school. On this acquaintance, he called on me one Saturday asternoon, his benefit being
announced for the following Monday. His prospects were very disheartening; but he said
that if he could get a patriotie song adapted to the tune of the ‘ President's March,' he did
not doubt of a full house; that the poets of theatrical corps had been trying to accomplish it,
but had not succeeded. I told him Ι would try what Ι could do for him. He came the next

afternoon, and the song was ready for him.
“ The object of the author was to get up an American spirit, which should be independent

of, and above the interests, passions, and policy of both belligerents‚ and look and feel exclu-
sively for our own honor and rights. No allusion is made to France or England, or the
quarrel between them, or to the question which was most at fault in their treatment of us. Of
course the song found favor with both parties, for both were American. Such is the history
of ‘ Hail, Columbia.' '’

AIL Columbia, happy land, As aband of brothers joined,
Hail, ye heroes! heaven-born band! Peace and safety we shall find.

Who fought and bled in freedom's cause, Immortal patriots' rige once more ι

Defend your rights, defend your shore;
Let no rude foe with impious hand,

Who fought and bled in freedom’s cause,
And when the storin of war was gone

Enjoyed the Peace your valor Won· Let no rude foe with im pious hand,

Let ¹¹³df³penden⁰e bf? our boaSt invade the shrine where sacred lies

EVffl' mmdfiss What η (30.5ῑῖ Of toil and blood the well-earned prize.

EVffl' grateful f01' the ΡΥῙΖΘ, While offering peace sincere and just,

Let 115 altar reach the skies. 10 Heaven we place a manly trust,
Firm, united let us be, That truth and justice will prevass,

Rallying round our liberty; And every scheme of bondage fail.
