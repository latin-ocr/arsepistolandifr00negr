C C HAVE seen myself in the strong, sharp your conscience in refusing to let me paint

light of truth. If you are willing to
be my friend, please be an honest one.

My faithful old friend in the country would
scarcely take my portrait if this perfect

flower were introduced with any such 1116311·
ing as you attach to it, and I certainly would
be ashamed to give it to him. Mr. Van Berg‚
we must let bygones be bygones, or we never
6311 get on. See how absurdly Ι have acted
both yesterday and to-day‚ and all through
recalling the past. Indeed, indeed, it 11111

“I’ll wear it simply as your gift, with
pleasure,'’ and she fastened it in her breastpin,

snowy whiteness of her neck.

He looked her full in the eyes as he said
earnestly, “ It is still the emblem of one thing,
and you cannot help it—of my respect for you.''

Her eyes fell guiltily, and the color deep-
ened in her face as she turned hastily away,
and said, with low, sad emphasis : “I do not
deserve such respect.'' Then the knowledge
that she was harboring a purpose which
troubled her conscience, but which she could
not abandon, became the cause of a trace of
her old recklessness of manner. She assumed
a sudden gayety, as if she had stepped out of
shadows into too strong a light, as she said ε
