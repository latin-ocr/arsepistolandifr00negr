GO TO THY REST.

O to thy rest, fair child!
Go to thy (11001111055 bed,
While yet so gentle, umilefiled,
With blessings on thy head.

Fresh 10505 111 thy hand,
Buds 011 thy pillow laid,
Haste from this dark and fearful land,

Where flowers 50 quiekly fade.

Ere 5111 1105 5001011 1110 breast,
Or sorrow waked the tear,

Rise to thy throne of changeless rest,
In yon celestial sphere!

Because thy smile was fair,
Thy lip and eye 50 bright,
Because thy loving eradle-care
Was such a (1001· delight,

Shall love, with weak embraee,
Thy upward wing detain?

N o! gentle angel, seek 11157 111000
Amisi the cherub 110111. *⁶

 

THE GORAL INSEGT.

OIL on! toil on! ye ephemeral 110111,
Who build in the tossing and 1100011010115
1110111 ;
Το11 on! for the wisdom of 111011 570 1110011, ⁴
With your saud-based struetures and domes of
roek,
Your columns the fathomless fountain's eave,
And your arches spring up to the erested wave ;
Ye’re a puny race thus to boldly rear
A fabrio so vast in a 1001111 50 (11001.

Ye bind the deep with your secret zone—-
The ocean is 5001011, 01111 1110 surge a stone,
Fresh wreaths from the 001·οῙ pavement spring,
Like the terraeed pride of Assyria's king :

The turf looks green where the breakers rolled ;

O'er the whirlpool ripens the 111111 of gold ;

The sea—snatehed isle is the home of 111011,

And mountains exult where 11105171ἶίἱο bath
been.

But why do ye plant, 'neath the billow's (10111,
The wreeking reef for the gallant bark‘?
There are suares enough on the tented field,
Mid the blossomed sweets that the valley yield ;
There are serpents to coil ere the flowers are
up,
There's a poison drop in man's purest cup,
There are foes that watch for his eradle breuth,
And why need ye sow the floods with death?
