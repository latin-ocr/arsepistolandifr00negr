WASHINGTON ALLSTON.

But now the sun is westward sinking;
And soon amid the purple haze,
That showers from his slanting rays,
A thousand loves there meet her gaze,
To change her high heroic thinking.

Then hope, with all its crowd of fancies,
Before her flits and fills the air3
And decked in victory's glorious gear,
In vision Isidor is there.

Then how her heart mid sadness dances!

Yet little thought she, thus forestalling
The coming joy, thatin that hour
The future, like the colored shower
That seems to arch the ocean o'er‚

Was in the living present falling.

The foe is slain. His sable charger
All flecked with foam comes bounding on,
The wild Morena rings anon,
And on its brow the gallant Don‚

And gallant steed grow larger‚ largcr;

And now he nears the mountain-hollow ;
The flowery bank aud little lake
Now on his startled vision break—
And Inez there.-—He's not awake—
Ah, what a day this dream will follow 1

But no—he surely is not dreaming.
Another minute makes it clear·
A scream, a rush, a burning tear
From Inez’ cheek, dispe] the fear

That bliss like his is only seeming.
