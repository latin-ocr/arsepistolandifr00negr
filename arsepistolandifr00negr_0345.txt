WILL CARLETON. 297

graceful poetic historians of a great phase of life in the progress of the
new world.

Mr. Carleton's poem “ Betsy and Ι are Out‚'‘ appeared in 1872 in the
“ Toledo Blade.” It was copied into “ Harpers‘ Weekly '’ and illustrated.
This was the beginning of the author's popularity and led to his engage-
ment with the Harpers for literary work.

In his preface to the first volume of his poems Mr. Carleton modestly
apologizes for whatever imperfectione, they may possess in a manner
which gives us some insight into his literary methods. ‘⁴ These poems,’'
he writes, “have been written under various, ansl in some cases difficult,
conditions: in the open air, with team afield3 in the student's den, with
ghosts of nnfinished lessons hovering gloomily about 3 amid the rush and
roar of railroad travel, which trains of thought are not prone to follow3
and in the editor’s sanctum, where the dainty feet of the muses do not
often deign to tread.‘'
