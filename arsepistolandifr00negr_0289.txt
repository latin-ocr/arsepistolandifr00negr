CHAUNCEY MITCHELL DEPEW. 241

In 1884 the United States senatorship was offered to Mr. Depew, but
business and professional engagements compelled him to decline the
honor. The delegates from New York voted unanimously for his nomi-
nation for the presidency in the National Republican Convention of 1888.
He withdrew his name, however, and four years later, in one of his most
captivating speeches, he presented the name of President Harrison to the
Convention for a second nomination. Mr. Harrison had already tendered
him the position of Secretary of State in his Cabinet after Mr. Blaine
resigned.

In 1899 Mr. Depew was elected United States Senator for New York,
and accepted the office.

In person Mr. Depew is above the medium height, has prominent
features and a clear, penetrating voice that can be heard by the largest
audiences.
