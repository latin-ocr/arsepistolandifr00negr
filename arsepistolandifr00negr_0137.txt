JAMES FENIMORE COOPER. 103

published a “ History of the Navy of the United States,'' which is a work

of much labor and some merit.
ἡ Among his later works are “The Pathfinder‚'’ (1840) “The Deer-
slayer,” (1841) “ Wing and &Vingss' (1842) “ Wyandotte‚'' (1843) “Afloat
and Ashore,'' (1844) “The Chain-Bearer,'' (1845) “ Oak OpeningS‚’' (1848)
and “The Ways of the Hour,'' (1850). He died at Cooperstown in
September, 1851. “ His writingS,'' says Vv’illiam H. Prescott, “ are instinct
, with the spirit of nationality. In his productioris every American must
take an honest pride. For surely no one has succeeded like Cooper in
the portraiture of American character, or has given such glowing and

eminently truthful pictures of American scenery.’'
“The same sort of magical authority over the spirit of romance,’'

says the “North American Review,’' “which belongs in common to Scott,
Radcliffe, Walpole‚ and our countryman Brown, is, for us at least,
possessed by this writer in an eminent degree.’‘ “We consider Mr,
Cooper,'’ says the same authority, “ as possessing in a very high degree
the first qualification to which we have adverted—that of power in
description. It is, however, most strikingly displayed in one department,
in which nobody has preceded him or has yet attempted to become his
rival. Whatever opinion may be entertained of his success in other
respects, all will agree that his boldest and most triumphant march is on
the mountain wave. He treads the deck with the same conscious pride
with which the Highland outlaw stood upon his native heath.''

“He wrote of mankind at large,'' says W. C. Bryant: “hence it is
that he has earned a fame wider than any American author. The crea-
tions of his genius shall survive through centuries to come, and only
perish with our language.”

Cooper’s workS, although written for a past generation and born of
the time in which their characters flourished‚ are still instinct with life
and a charm that is irresistible. They appeal to the imagination, to the
love of genuine romance and are destined to a perpetual popularity.

Mr. Cooper was a prolific writer, as may be seen from the list of his
published works. That he should have written so much and with scarcely
a page that does not show real literary merit, is a remarkable tribute to
his genius, He has been called the “KValter Scott of America,’' and
- indeed there is a marked resemblance between these two great Authors.
