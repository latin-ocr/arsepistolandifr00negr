HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW. 29

Day after day we think what she is doing
In those bright realms of air;

Year after year, her tender steps pursuing,
Behold her grown more fair.

Thus do we walk with her, and keep unbroken
Thinking that our remembrance, thoitsglliktixli:

The bond which nature gives,

May reach her where she lives.

Not as a child shall we again behold her;
For when with raptures wild
In our embraces we again enfold her,

She will not be a child;

But a. fair maiden‚ in her father's mansion,

Clothed with celestial graee;

And beautiful with all the soul's expansion

Shall we behold her face.

And though at times impetuous with emotion

And anguish long suppressed, [ocean,

The swelling beart heaves moaning like the

That cannot be at rest——

We will be patient, and assuage the feeling

We may not wholly stay ;

By silence sanctifying, not concealing,

The grief that must have way.

 

A PSALM OF LIF'E.

The fame of this poem is, perhaps, not surpassed by any other in the English language,
and all on account of its practical sense, homely wisdom, easy versification, and high

ideal held up to youth.

ELL me not, in mournful numbers,
Life is but an empty dream 1

For the soul is dead that slumbers,
And things are not what they seem.’'

Life is real! life is earnest!
And the grave is not its goal!
‘⁶ Dust thou art, to (lust returnest,''
VVas not spoken of the soul.

Not enjoymcnt, and not sorrow,
Is our destined end or way ;
But to act, that each to-morrow‚
Find us farther than to-day.

Art is long, and time is fleeting,
And our hearts, though stout and brave,
Still, like muffled drums, are beating
Funeral marches to the grave.

In the world's broad field of battle,
In the bivouac of life,

 

Be not like dumb, driven cattle ἔ
Be a hero in the strifel

Trust no future, howe’ver pleasant !
Let the dead past bury its dead 1

Act—act in the living present l
Heart within, and God o'erhead.

Lives of great men all remind us
We can make our lives sublime,

And, departing, leave behind us
Footprints on the sands of time:

Footprints, that perhaps another,
Sailing o'er life's solemn main,

A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,
Seeing‚ shall take beart again.

Let us, then, be up and doing,
With a heart for any fate ;

still achieving, still pursuing,
Learn to labor and to wait.

 

LIVES OF SOHOLARS*

HAT a strange picture a university has, no doubt, for some wise purpose, placed

presents to the imagination.

The in their hearts this love of litet-ary labour

lives of scholars in their cloistered and seclusion. Otherwise, who would feed
stillness ;—literary men of retired habits, and the undying lamp of thought? But for such
professors who study sixteen hours a day, and men as these, a blast of wind through the
