SAMUEL TAYLoR CoLERmoE.
Poet and philosopher.

 

⁶ ⁶ AMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE, was born in Devonshire, Eng-
„ X ἱ land, October 21, 1772. He was left an orphan at the age of nine,
Η . and was presented to Christ's Hospital, where he began his
‘⁴¹⁶ education and formed an intimacy with Charles Lamb, one of
his school-fellows. In 1791 he entered Cambridge University,
but remained there scarcely two years, quitting college to enlist
in the dragoons‚ under an assumed name. His relatives soon secured
his discharge. In 1794 he formed the friendship of Southey, who, like
himself, was a liberal in both politics and religion. He and Southey
married sisters.

Taking up his residence at Nether Stowey, Somersetshire, he was
thrown much into the company of Wordsworth, the two poets finding
each other exceedingly congenial. He and Wordsworth traveled through
Germany together, and in 1801, together with Wordsworth and Southey
he settled at Keswick. Coleridge became interested in the study of
metaphysics and theology, and was probably the first to clearly unfold
German philosophy to English thought. While a great genius, his
character was not without its infirmities‚ which were aggravated by the
use of opium. He died July 25, 1834.

 

 

HYMN BEF'ORE SUNRISE AT THE FOO'I' OF MONT BLANG.

WAKE, my soul! not only passive praise‚
Α Thou owest? not alone these swelling
ars
Mute thanktg an'd secret ecstacy! Awake‚
Voice of sweet song Ι Awake my heart, awake!
Green vales and icy eliffs, all join my hymn.

Companion of the morning-star at dawn,
Thyself Earth's rosy star, and of the dawn
Co-herald,—wake, O, wake, and utter praise!
tho sank thy sunless pillars deep in earth?
Who filled thy countenance with rosy light?
tho made thee parent of perpetual streams‘?

 

Thou first and chief, sole sovereign of the
τ
O, strugglliing with the darkness all the night,
And visited all night by troops of stars,
Or when they climb the sky or when they sink,—

And you, ye five wild torrents fiercely glad!
Who called you forth from night and utter
From ᾶῖῖῗὶὲυᾶ icy caverns called you forth,
Down those precipitous, black, jagged rocks,
