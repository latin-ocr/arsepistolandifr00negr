And the girlhood dreams, once vanished, ³

Come back in her winter-time,
Till her feeble pulses tremble
With the thrill of spring-time's prime.

And looking forth from the window‚
She thinks how the trees have grown

Since, clad in her bridal whiteness,
She crossed the old door-stone.

 

 

LOUISE CHANDLER MOULTON.

Though dimmed her eyes' bright azure,
And dimmed her hair’s young gold,
The love in her girlhood plighted
Has never grown dim or old.

They sat in peace in the sunshine
Till the day was almost done,

And then, at its close, an angel
Stole over the threshold stone

 

THE OLD HOME.

’M standing by the window-sill,
Ι Where we have stood of yore;
The sycamore is waving still
Its branchos near the door;
And near me creeps the wild rose-vine
On which our wreaths were hung—
Still round the porch its tendrils twine.
As when we both were young.

The little path that used to lead
Down by the river shore

Is overgrown with brier and weed—
Not level as before.

But there’s no change upon the hill,
From whence our voices rung—

The violets deck the summit still,
As when we both were young.

And yonder is the old oak-tree,
Beneath whose spreading shade,
When our young hearts were light and free,
In innocence we played ;
And over there the meadow gate
On which our playmates swung, ·
Still standing in its rustic state,
As when we both were young.

ROBER'I' EAS'I'MAN.
FROM “MY THIRD BOOK.”

(ί Ε was the noblest man Ι ever knew,
H this Robert Eastman. In his place,
how many would have pursued me,
all my life through, with vengeful hate; but
to him the love which Caroline had borne
me rendered me sacred. Caroline had under-
stood him well. He had loved her deeply ;
he had mourned for her truly. Had he been,
as Ι was, the beloved of her soul‚ he would
have consecrated all his life to her memory.
“But he knew that she had never loved
him ; that, in the most sacred sense, she had
never been his wife3 and, after a few years,
he married again, this time a pale, blonde
beauty; a gentle, quiet woman, very unlike
’ Caroline. They were happy. They have
passed fifteen years of their life together. It
has been like a perfect day, growing brighter
toward the afternoon. Ι think it is one of
those heaven-made marriages which death
only makes eternal.

“For myself, after the first shock was over,
Ι think Caroline's death was almost a com-
fort to me. She had 'never seemed so truly ‹
mine as when Ι stood beside her grave. Ι am ’
technically no spiritualist. I do not believe ¹
in physical demonstrations; I have had none ¹
of her presence5 and yet I know that !
many a midnight she has watched over my 1
slumbers‚ that her free soul walks through .-
life at my side. I believe, as truly as I be· 1
lieve in heaven, that she will be mine here·
after; that, when the messenger comes for me
who comes for all, she will guide me across
the tideless, fathomless waters, and be mine
on the other side3 mine in all the changeless ⁷
radience of her beauty, the glory of her im-
mortal love, and her immortal youth. I shall
be young again there.''

I looked at him as heceased speaking. A
great light, as of a mighty hope, sat on hi!
face.
