PLEA OF SERGEANT BUZF'UZ, IN “BARDELL VERSUS PICKWIOK.”
FROM “PICKWICK PAPERs.”

HE plaintiff, gentlemen, the plaintiff is a
widow; yes, gentlemen, a widow. The
late Mr.Ba1·dell, after enjoying for many

years, the esteem and confidence of his sover-
eign, as one of the gnardians of his royal
revennes, glided almost i111perceptibly from
the world, to scel< elsewhere for that repose
and peace which a custom-house can never
afl'ord. Some time before his death 116 had
stamped his likencss upon a little boy. With
this little boy, the only pledge of her departed
exciseman, M rs Bardell shrunk from the world,
and courted the retirement and tranquility
of Goswell street; and here she placed in her
front parlor window a written placard, bear-
ing this inscription—“ Apartments furnished
for a single gentleman. Inquire within.” Ι
entreat the attention of the jury to the word-
ing of this document—“ Apartments furnished
for a single gentleman!’' Mrs. Bardell's
opinions of the opposite sex, gentlemen, were
derived from a long contemplation of the
inestimable qualities of her lost husband.
She had no sear—she had no distrust—she
had no suspicion—all was confidence and re-
liance.

“ Mr. Bardell,” said the widow; “ Mr.
Bardell was a man of honor—Mr. Bardell
was a man of his word—Mr. Bardell was no
deceiver-Mn Bardell was once a single gen-
tleman himself; to single gentlemen I look
for protection, for assistance, sor comfort, and
for consolation—in single gentlemen I shall
perpetually see something to remind me of
what Mr. Bardell was, when he first won my
young and untried afl'eclions; to a single gen-
tleman, then, shall my lodgings be let.''
Actuated by this beautiful and touching im-
pulse (among the hest impulses of ourim1:e1·-

late widow dried her tears, furnished her first
fioor, caught her innocent boy to her maternal
bosom, and put the bill up in her parlor
window. Did it remain there long? No.
The serpent was on the watch, the train was
laid, the mine was preparing, the sapper and
miner was at work.

Before the bill had been in the parlor
window three days—three days, gentlemen—
a being, erect upon two legs, and bearing all
the outward semblance of a man, and not of
a monster, knoekcd at the door of Mrs. Bar-
dell's house. He inquired within; he took
the lodgings; and on the very next day he
entered into possession of them. This man
was Pickwick—Pickwick‚ the defendant. .

Of this man Pickwick Ι will say little;
the subject presents but few attractions3 and
I, gentlemen, am not the man, nor are you, ’
gentlemen, the men to delight in the contem· .
plation of revolting heartlessness and sys- ³⁷
tematic villany. I say systematic villany‚
gentlemen, and when I say systematic villany‚
let me tell the defendant, Pickwick, if he be ”
in court, as I am informed he is, that it would
have been more decent in him, more becom-
ing, in better judgmert, and in better taste, if
he had stopped away. Let me tell him, gen·
tlemen‚ that any gestures of dissent or disap-
probation in which he may indulge in this
court will not go down with y0u3 that you
will know how to value and how to appre- i
ciate them 3 and let me tell him further, as
my lord will tell you, gentlemen, that a.
counsel, in his discharge of his duty to his
client, is'neither to be intimidated, nor b‘ullied‚
nor put down; and that any attempt to do
either the one or the other, or the firssc'ifflffi
last, will recoil on the head of the attemptet,

sect nature, gentlelnen), tho lonely and deso- be 116 plaintiff, or be he defendant, be hie
