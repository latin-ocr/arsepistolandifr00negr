>TIS a fearful night in the winter time, The night sets in on aworld of snow,

As cold as it ever can be ; [chime While the air grows sharp and chill,
The roar of the blast is heard like the And the warning roar of a fearful blow
Of the wavcs on an 'angry sea. Is heard on the distant hill;
The moon is full; but her silver light And the ilortlier, 8661 011 the mountain peak
The stoi-m dashes out with its wings to-night : In hisbreath how the old trees writhe and shriek! .
And over the sky from south to north He shouts on the plain, ho-hol lio-hol
Not a star is seen, as the wind comes forth He drives from his nostrils the blinding snow, ν
In the strength of.a mighty glee. And growls with a savage will.
All day had the snow come down—all day Such a night as this to be found ahroad,
As it never came down before; In the drifts and the freezing air,
And over the 111118, at sunset, lay Sits a shivering dog, in the field, by the road,
Some two or three feet, or more t With the snow in his shaggy hair.
The sence was lost, and the wall of stone3 He shuts his eyes to the wind and growls;

The windows blocked and the well-curbs gone: He lifts his head, and moans and 11011118;·

The haystack had grown to a mountain list, Then crouching low, from the cutting 81661,

Α11(1 1116 wood-pile looked like a monsterdrift, His nose is pressed on his quivering feet—
As it lay by the farmer's door. Pray‚ what does the dog do there?
