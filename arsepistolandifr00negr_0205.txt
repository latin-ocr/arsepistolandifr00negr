WILLIAM HICKLING PRESCOTT. 157

he was struggling through the arrangements for beginning to write his
‘Ferdinand and Isabella‚' and in fact, during the whole period of its
composition. But he showed the same character, the same fertility of
resource, every day of his life, and provided, both by foreeast and sels-
sacrifice, against the embarrassments of his condition as they successively
presented themselves.

“The first thing to be done, and the thing always to be repeated day
by day, was to strengthen, as much as possible, what remained of his
sight, and at any rate, to do nothing that should tend to exhaust its
impaired powers. In 1821, when he was still not without some hope of

of merit.

Mr. Prescott travelled much in Europe, obtaining materials for some
of his works from original sources. He was pre-eminently a student
and scholar, and scarcely less an author.

Mr. Prescott perhaps excels most in description and narration, but
his histories combine in a high degree almost every merit that can belong
to such works. They are pervaded by a truly and profoundly philosoph-
ical spirit, the more deserving of recognition because it is natural and
unobtrusive, and are distinguished above all others for their uniform
candor, a quality which might reasonably be demanded of an American
writing of early European policy and adventure. In private life, no man
was more admired and beloved. He was not more remarkable for his
abilities and acquirements than for his amiability, simplicity, and high-
