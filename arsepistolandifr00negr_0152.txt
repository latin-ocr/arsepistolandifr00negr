Mr. Clemens' most successful work was “The Innocents Abroad.''

His other well known works are “ Adventures of Tom Sawyer ’' (1876),
“ Adventures of Huckleberry Finn '' (188 5), and “ Persona] Recollections
of Joan of Arc '' (1896). Other productioris of more or less merit have
been issued from time to time.

Having established the publishing house of C. L. Webster & Co„
Mr. Clemens issued the Memoirs of U. S. Grant, which the General ,
finished shortly before his death. From the profits of this publication,
11350600 were paid to Μ15. Grant in accordance with an agreement made
by her distinguished husband before his death. The company failed in
1895 and made Mark Twain a poor man. He was heavily in debt, but
like Walter Scott resolved to pay all that he owed. He went on a lectur-
ing tour around the world, and returning‚ connected himself with the
house of Harper Eros, in New York, and seems to have repeated the suc-
cesses of his earlier life.

PLAYING JOKES ΟΝ Α GUIDE.

UROPEAN guides know about enough
English to tangle every thing up so
that a man can make neither head nor

tail of it. They know their story by heart—
the history of every statue, painting, cathe-
dral, or other wonder they show you. They
know it and tell it as a parrot would ; and if
you interrupt, and throw them off the track,
they have to go back and begin over again.
All their lives long, they are employed in
showing strange things to foreigners and lis-
tening to their bursts of admiration.

After we discovered this, we never went into
ecstacies any more, we never admired any-
thing, we never showed any but impassible
faces aud stupid indifference in the presence of
the sublimest wonders a guide had to display.
We had found their weak point. We made
some of those people savage, at times, but we
never lost our serenity.

The doctor asked the questions generally,
because he can keep his countenance, and look
more like au inspired idiot, and throw more
imbecility into the tone of his voice than any
man that lives. It comes natural to him.

The guides in Genoa are delighted to secure
an American party, because Americans so ἶ

and emotion before any relic of Columbus.
Our guide there fidgeted about as if he had
swallowed a spring mattress. He was full of
animation—full of impatience.

He said t

“Come wis me, genteelmen 1-6011161 I
show you ze letter writing by Christopher
Colombo 1—-write it himself l—write it wis his
own hand l—come! '’

He took us to the munici pal palace. After
much impressive fumbling of keys and opening
of locks, the stained and aged document was
spread before us. The guide's eyes sparkled.
He danced about us and tapped the parchment
with his finger.

“that I tell you, genteelmen! Is it not
so? See! handwriting Christopher Colombol
—-write it himself! ’²

We looked indifferent, unconcerned. The -
doctor examined the document very deliber· 2
ately, during a painful pause. Then he said, ’
without any show of interest,
