ἶ 2425· ARLY New England history has furnished Mrs. Austin with

ζ’( ff abundant material for her interesting stories, in several of
ἵ ¹ which she describes the character of the Pilgrims, their strug-
gles, sacrifices and heroic endurance. Her writings commem-
orate an important period in'our national life and form a glow-
ing record of the brave souls who conquered the wilderness:

 

“ Murmuring the names of mighty men,
They bid our streams roll on ;
And link high thoughts to every glen
VVhere valiant deeds were done.''

The descendants of the early settlers of Plymouth‚ Boston, Salem
and other localities, are indebted to Mrs. Austin for her successful rescue
from oblivion of much that should be embodied in the standard history
of our country. She made repeated visits to Plymouth‚ Massachusetts‚
and other places associated with the PuritanS‚ in order to become more
fully acquainted, by personal investigation‚ with the characters she was
to delineate and the events and traditions associated with their entry into
the new world.

Herself a descendant of the Mayflower Pilgrims in several distinct
lines, it is not, perhaps surprising that she should become the chronicler
of their sufferings and achievcmentS. But let it not be supposed she is
a blind worshipper of their heroic traitS‚ or an apologist for their frailtieS.
’ She aims to present truthful portraits and make record of authentic history.

MrS. Austin was born at WVorcester, Massachusetts‚ 1831. Her
maiden name was Goodwin. Her father was a prominent lawyer and
genealogist. Her mother was a person of literary tendencies, a student
of history and had a rich fund of anecdotes and traditions‚ many of which
Mrs. Austin has embodied in her works.

Mrs. Austin wrote a series of “ Pilgrim Story-books‚’' the fifth and
last of which was finished in 1891. The best of these are “The Name-

less Nobleman‚'’ 18813 “Standish of Standish,'' 18893 and “Betty Alden‚''
