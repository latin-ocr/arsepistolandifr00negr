WILLIAM PENN.

ΡΕΝ Ν, despairing of relies in Europe, bent

the whole energy of his mind to accom-
plish the establishment of a free govern-
ment in the New World. For that “ heavenly
end,” he was prepared by the severe discipline
of life, and the love, without dissimulation,
which formed the basis of his character. The
sentiment of oheerful humanity was irrepressi-
bly strong in his bosom; as with John Eliot
and Roger Williams‚ benevolence gushed
prodigally from his ever-flowing heart; and
when, in his late old age, his intellect was im—
paired, and his reason prostrated by apoplexy,
his sweetness of disposition rose serenely over
the clouds of disease.
Possessing an extraordinary greatness of
mind, vast conceptions, remarkable for their
universality aud precision‚ and “surpassing in

speculative endowments;” eonversant with
men, and books, aud governments, with vari-
ous languages, and the forms of politieal com*
binations, as they existed in England ancl
France, in Holland‚ aud the principalitics
and free eities of Germany, he yet sought the
source of wisdom in his own soul. Humano
by nature and by suffering; familiar with the
royal family; intimate with Sunderland and
Sydney; acquainted with RusseL Halissagz,
Shaftesbury, and Buekingham; as a member
of the Royal Society, the peer of N ewton and
the great scholars of his age—he valued the
promptings of a free mind more than the
awards of the learned, and revereneed the
single-minded sincerity of the N ottingham
shepherd more than the authority of eolleges
and the wisdom of philosophers.
