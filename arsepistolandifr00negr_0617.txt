HOLLAND.
FROM “THE TRAVELER.”

O men of other minds my fancy flies,
Embosomed in the deep where Holland
lies,

Methinks her patient sons before me stand,
11711616 1116 broad ocean 163115 against the land,
And, sedulous to stop the coming tide,
Lift the tall rampire’s artificial pride.
Onward methinks‚ and diligently slmv,
The firm connected hulwark 5661115 to grow ;
Spreads 115 long arms amidst 1116 watery roar,
Scoops out an empire, and usurps the shore.
While the pent ocean, rising o'er 1116 11116,

 

Sees 1111 amphibious world beneath him smile:
The slow caual, the yellow-lssossomed vale
The willow-tufted bank, the gliding sail,

The crowded mart, the cultivated plain,

A new creation rcscued from his reign.

Thus while around the wave-subjected soil
Impels the native to repeated toil,

Ι 11111151116115 habits 111 each bosom reign,

And industry hegcts a love of gain.

Hence all the good from opulence that springs
With all those ills superfluous treasure brings
Are 11616 displayed.

MOSES AND THE SPEGTAOLES.
111οΜ “THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD.⁷’

HEN we returned home, the night was
dedicated to 5611611165 of future con-
quest. Even in 11611 my wife kept

up the usual theme.

“ Well‚ saith, my 11631 01131165, between
ourselves, Ι think we have made an excellent
day's work of it.''

“ Pretty well!'' cried I, not knowing what
to say.

“What‚ only pretty well 1” returned shc;
“I think it is very well. Suppose the girls
should come to make acquaintances of taste in
town. This I um assured of, that London is
the only place in the world for all manner of
husbands. Resides, my 116111, stranger things
happen every day; and as ladies of quality
arc so takrn with my daughter-S, what will not
men of quality be? Entre nous, Ι 11161651 Ι
like my Lady Blarney vastly; so very oblig-
ing. However, Miss Carolina 1171111611111113
Amolia Skeggs has my warm heart. But yet,
when they came to talk of places in town,
you saw at once how Ι 11311611 them. Tell me,
my dear, don't you think I did for my children
there ‘? ''

“Ay‚'' returned Ι, 1161 knowing well what

. to think of the matter; “ Heaven grant that

they may be both the better for it this day three
months 1 '⁷ This was one of those observa-
tions I usually made to impress my wife with

 

an opinion of my sagacity; for if the girls
511666611611,111611 it was a pious wish fulfilled; but
if anything unfortunate ensued, then it might
be looked upon as a prophecy. All this con-
versation, however, was only preparatory to
another scheme, and, indeed, Ι 1116311611 35
11111611. Τ1115 was nothing less than that, 115
we were now to hold up our heads a little
highcr in 1116 world, it would be proper to soll
the colt, which was grown old, at 1116 neigh-
horing fair, and buy 115 3 1111156 which would
carry single or 1111111116 11111111 311 occasion, and
make a pretty appearance at church or upon
a visit. This at first I opposed stoutly, but it
was as stoutly defended. However, as Ι
weakened‚ my antagonist gained strength, till
at last it was resolved to part with him.

As the fair happened 011 the following day,
Ι had intentions of going myself; 11111 my wife
persuaded me that I had got a cold, and
nothing could prevail upon her to permit me
from home.

“ No, my dear,’' said she, “ our son Moses is
a discreet hoy, and can buy and 5611 to very
good advantage ; you know all our great bar-
gains are of his purchasing. He always
stands out and higgles3 and actually tires them
till he gets a bargain.”

As I had some opinion of my son's pru-
dence, I was willing enough to entrust him
