MARK TWAIN’ S WATOH.

Y beautiful new watch had run eighteen
months without-losing or gaining‚ and
without breaking any part of its

machinery, or stopping. Ι had come to believe
it infallible in its judgments about the time of
day, and to consider its constitution and its
anatomy imperishable. But at last, one night,
I let it run down. I grieved about it as if it
were a recognized messenger and forerunncr
of calamity. But by-and-by Ι cheered up, set
the watch by guess, and commanded my bod-
ings and superstitious to depart. N ext day Ι
stepped into the chief jeweler⁷s to set it by the
exact time, and the head of the establishment
took it out of my hand and proceeded to set
it for me. Then he said, “ She is four minutes
slow—regulator wants pushing up.'' Ι tried
to stop him—tried to make him understand
that the watch kept perfect time.

But no; all this human cabbage could sce
was that the watch was four minutes slow, and
the regulator 77ιίιεύ be pushed up a little ; and
so, while Ι danced around him in anguish, and
implored him to let the watch alone, he clamly
and oruelly did the shameful deed. My watch
began to gain. It gained faster and faster
day by day. Withiu the week it sickened to
a raging fever, and its pulse went up to a
hundred and fifty in the shade. At the end
of two months it had left all timepieces of the
town far iu the rear, and was a fraction over
thirteen days abead of the almanac.

It was away into November enjoying the
snow, while the October leaves were still turn-
· ing. It hurried up house rent, bills payable,
-and such things, in such a ruinous way that Ι
could not abide it. I took it to the watch-

maker to be regulated. He asked me if I had

ever had it repaired. Ι said no, it had never
needed any repairing. He looked a look of
vicious happiness and eagerly pried the watch
open, and then put a small dice box into his
eye and peered into its machinery. He said
it wanted cleaning and oiling, besides regulat-
ing—come in a week.

After being cleaned, and oiled, and regu-
lated, my watch slowed down to that degree
that it ticked like a tolling bell. Ι began to
be left by trains, Ι failed all appointments, I
got to missing my dinner; my watch strung
out three day's grace to four and let me go tov
pr‹›test;I gradually drifted back into yester-
day, then day before, then into last week, and
by-and-by the comprehension came upon me
that all sditary and alone Ι was lingering
along in week before last, and the world was
out of sight, I seemed to detect in myself a
sort of sneaking fellow-feeling for the mummy
in the museum, and a desire to swop news with

him.
Ι went with a heavy heart to one more

watchmaloer, and looked on while he took her
to pieces. Then Ι prepared to cross-question
him rigidly‚ for this thing was getting serious.
The watch had cost two hundred dollars
originally, and Ι seemed to have paid out two
or three thousand for repairs. While Ι waited
and looked on Ι presently recognized in this
watchmaker an old acquaintance—a steam-
boat engineer of other days, and not a good
engineer either. He examined all the parts
carefully, just as the other watchmakers had
done, and then delivered his verdict.

He said—“ She makes too much steam—
you want to hang the monkey-wrench on the
safety valve !''
