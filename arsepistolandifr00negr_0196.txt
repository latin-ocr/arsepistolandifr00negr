OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES-

OLD IRONSIDES.

The frigate “ Constitution,'' whose glorious record is known to all familiar with our nava]
history, was saved from destruction by the following beautiful lines of Dr. Holmes, which
caused the people to pause, and reconsider their determination of breaking up the nation's
favorite. They were published in the form of a handbill and distributed in the streets of

Washington.

Y, tear her tattered ensign down !
Long has it waved 011 high,
And many an eye has danced to see
That banner in the sky;
Beneath it rung the battle-shout,
And burst the cannon's roar:
The 11101001· of the ocean air
811311 sweep the clouds no more!

Her deck, once red wilh heroes' blood,
Where knelt the vanquished foe,

When winds were hurrying o'er the flood,
And waves were white below.

No more shall feel the victor's tread,
Or know the conquered knee;

The harpies of the shore shall pluck
The eagle of the sea!

O, better that her shattered hulk
Should sink beneath the wave ;

Her thunders shook the mighty deep,
And there should be her grave ;

N ail to the mast her holy flag,
801 every threadbare sail,

And give her to the god 0151011115,-
The lightning and the gale!

EVERYONE HAS TWO DOORS.

FROM “THE AUTOCRAT OF THE BREAKFAST TABLE.'’

VERY person’s feelings have a front-
E door and a side-door by which they
may be entered. The front-door is on
1110 street. 801110 keep it always open3 some
keep it latched ; some, locked; some, hosted,—
with a chain that will let you peep in, but
not get in; and some nail it up, so that 110111-
ing can pass its threshold. This front-door
lcads into a passa-ge which opens into an
ante-room, and this into the interior apart-
ments. This side—door opens at once into the
sacred chambers.

There is almost always at least one key to
this side-door. This is carried for years hid-
(1011 111 3 mother's bosom. Fathers, brothers,
sisters, and friends, often, but by no means so
universally, have duplicates of it. The wed-
ding-ring conveys a right to one; alas, if none
is given with it!

If nature or accident has put one of these
keys into the hands of a person who has the
torturing instinct, I 0311 only solemnly pro·
nounce the words that J ustice utters over its

doomed victim,—The Lord have mercy on
your soul! You will probably go mad within
a reasonable time,—or, if you are a man, run
off and die with your head on a emb-stone, in
Melbourne or San Francisco,—or, if you are
a woman, quarrel and break your heart, or
turn into a pale, jointed petrifaction that
moves about as if it were alive, or play some v
real life-tragedy 01· other.

Be very careful to whom you trust one of
these keys of the side-door. The fact of pos·
sessing one r'enders those even who are dear
to you very terrible at times. You can keep
the world out from your from-door, or receive -
visitors only when you are ready for them; ,τ
but those of your own flesh and blood, or of .
certain grades of intimacy, can come in at the .
side-door, if they will, at any hour and in any
mood. Some of them have a scale of your
whole nervous system, and can play all the .
gamut of your sensibilities in semitones,—
touching the naked nerve pulps as a pianist
strikes the keys of his instrument. I am
