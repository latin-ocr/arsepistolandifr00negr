MARIETTA HOLLEY.

He blushed up red; he was ashamed; and
he said, “ he would see if I could be admitted.’'

Ι was jest a-thinkin' this when the hired
man came back, and said,—

“ The President would receive me.''

“ Wa11,’' says Ι, calmly, ‘⁴ Ι 6111 ready to be
received.'’

So I follered him ; and he led the way into
. a beautiful room, kinder round, and red-
colored, with lots of elegant pictures and
, lookin’-glasses and books.

He then shook hands with me, and I with
him. I, too, am a perfect lady. And then
116 drawed up a chair for me with his own
hands (hands that grip holt of the same hellum
that G. W. had gripped holt of. O soul! be
calm when Ι think on't), and asked me to set
down; and consequently Ι 301.

Ι leaned my umberell in a easy, careless
position against a adjacent chair, adjusted my
long green veil in long, graceful folds,—I
hain't vain, but Ι like to look well,—and then
I at 01166 told him of my errents. I told
him-

“I had brought three 61161113 tohim from
Jonesville,—one for myself, and two for Dor-
lesky Burpy.'’

He bowed, but didn’t say nothin' : he looked
tired. J osiah always looks tired in the morn-
in’ when he has got his milkin’ and barn-
chores done, so it didn't surprise me. And
havin' calculated to tackle him on my own
errent first, consequently I tackled him.

I told him how deep my 10176 and devotion
10 my pardner wuz. ‘

And he said “he had heard of it.'’

And Ι says, “I s'pose so. I s'pose such
things will spread, bein' a sort of a rarity.
I'd heard that it had got 0111, 'way beyend

Loontown, and all round.''
“Yes,'' 116 said, “it was spoke of a good

deffilwan’„ says I, “the cast-iron love and de-

votion Ι feel for that man don’t show off the
brightest in hours of joy and peace. It
towers up strongest in dangers and troublessss’

And when Ι went on to tell him how Josiah
wanted to come there 63 6 senator, and what
a dangerous place I had always heard lVash-
ington wuz, and how Ι had felt it was impossi-
ble for me to lay down on my goose-feather
pillow at home, in peace and safety, while my
pardner was a-grapplin' with dangers of
which I did not know the exact size and heft.
Then, says Ι, solemnly, “ Ι ask you, not as a
politician‚ but as a human bein', would you
dast to let Josiah come?”

The President didn't act surprised amite.
And finally he told me, what Ι had always
mistrusted, but never knew, that Josiah had
wrote to him all his political views and aspira-
tions, and offered his help to the government.
And says he, “ Ι think Ι know all about the
man.''

“ Then,” says Ι, “ you see he is a good deal
like other men.'’

And he said, sort o' dreamily, “that he
was.”

Finally the suspense of the moment wore
onto me too deep to bear, and Ι says, in
almost harrowin' tones of anxiety and 3113-
pense,—

“ Would it be safe for my pardner to come
to VVashington? Would it be safe for Josiah,
safe for the nation‘? '' Says Ι, 111 deeper, moui-n-
fuller tenes,—

“Would you—would you dast to let him
come ‘?''

And he said, in gentle, gracious 101163, ‘⁴ If
I tell you just what I think, Ι would not like
to say it officially, but would say it in confi-
dence, as from an Allen to an Allen.''

Says Ι, “ It shan't go no fnrther.''

And so Ι would warn everybody that it
must not be told.

Then says he, “ I will tell you. Ι wouldn't
dast.''

Says I, “That settles it. If human efforts
can avail, Josiah Allen will not be United
States Senator.’' And says I, “You have
only confirmed my fears. Ι knew, feelin’ as
he felt, that it wuzn’t safe for Josiah or the
11611011 10 have him come.’'

Agin he reminded me that it was told to
me in confidence, and agiu Ι want to say that
it must be kep'.
