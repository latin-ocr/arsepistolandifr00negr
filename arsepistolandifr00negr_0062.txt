42 WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.

Nor how, when strangers found his bones,

They dressed the hasty bier,

And marked his grave with nameless stones,

Unmoistened by a tear.

But long they looked, and feared, and wept,

Within his distant home ;

¹ And dreamed, and started as they slept‚

For joy that he had come.

Long, long they looked—-but never spied

His welcome step again.

Nor knew the fearful death he died

Far down that narrow glen.

 

THE: AFRIOAN GHIEF.

The story of the African Chief related iu this ballad is well known. The chief was a
warrior of majest-ic stature, brother of the king of the Solima nation.
taken in battle and was brought in chains for sale to the Rio Pongas, where he was exhlbited
in the market-place, his ankles still adorned with the massive rings of gold which hc wore
when captured. The refusal of his captor to listen to his offers of ransom drove him mad.

HAINED in the market-place he stood, Then wept the warrior chief, and bade

A man of giant frame,
Amid the gathering multitude
That shrunk to hear his name—
All stern of look and strong of limb
His dark eye on the ground :—
And silently they gazed on him,
As on a lion bound.

Vainly‚ but well, that chief had fought,
He was a captive now,

Yet pride, that fortune humbles not,
XVas written 011 his brow.

The scars his dark broad bosom wore,
Showed warrior true and brave ;

A prince among his tribe before,
He could not be a slave.

Then to his conqueror he spake—
“ My brother is a king ε

Undo this necklace from my neck,
And take this bracelet ring,

And send me where my brother reigns,
And I will fill thy hands

With store of ivory from the plains,
And gold-dust from the sands.'’

“ Not for thy ivory nor thy gold
Will I unbind thy chain;

That bloody hand shall never hold
The battle-spear again.

A price thy nation never gave
Sball yet be paid for thee;

For thou shalt be the Christian's slave,
In lands beyond the sea.''

To shred his locks away 3

And one by one, each heavy braid
Before the victor lay.

T hick were the platted looks, and long,
And closely hidden there

Sh‹›ne many a wedge of gold among
The dark aud crisped hair.

“ Look, feast thy greedy eye with gold
Long kept for sorest need :

Take it—thou askest surus uutold.
And say that Ι am freed.

Take it—my wife, the long, long day,
Weeps by the cocoa-tree,

And my young children leave their play,
And ask in vain for me.''

“ I take thy gold—but I have made
Thy fetters fast and strong,

And ween that by the cocoa shade
Thy wife will wait thee loug.’'

Strong was the agouy that shook
The captive’s frame to hear,

And the proud meaning of his look
Was changed to mortal fcar.

His beart was broken—crazed his brain ;
At once his eye grew wild ;

He struggled fiercely with his chain,
WVhispere-d, and wept, and smiled ;

Yet wore not long those fatal bands,
And once, at shut of day,

They drew him forth upon the sands,
The foul hyena's prey.
