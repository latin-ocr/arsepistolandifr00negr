great originality‚ but a rare power of subtle analysis‚ a delicate and exqui-
site humor, and a marvelous felicity in the use of language. His style,
indeed, may be said to combine almost every excellence—elegance‚ sim-

phcity, grace, clearness and force.

GOMPANIONSHIP WITH OHILDREN.

WEET has been the eharm of childhood
on my spirit, throughout my ramble with
little Anuie! Say not that it has been

a waste of precious moments, an idle matter,
a babble of childish talk, and a reverie'of
childish imaginations about topics unworthy
of a grown man's notice. Has it been merely
this? Not so; not so. They are not truly
wise who would affirm it. As the pure breath
of children revives the life of aged men, so is
our moral nature revived by their free and
simple thoughts, their native feeling, their airy
mirth, for little cause or none, their grief, soon
roused and soon allayed. Their influence on
us is at least reciprocal with ours on them.

then our infancy is almost forgotten, and
our boyhood long depmted, though it seems
but as yesterday ; when life settles darkly down
upon ns, and we doubt whether to call our-
selves young any more, then it is good to steal
away from the society of bearded men, and
even of gentler women, and spend an hour or
two with children. After drinking from those
fountains of still fresh existence, we shall
return into the crowd, as I do now, to struggle
onward and do our part in life, perhaps as fer-

vently as ever, but, for a time, with a kinder ¹

and purer heart, and a spirit more lightly

LITTLE PEARL AND HER. MOTHER.

O the mother and little Pearl were admit-
ὃ ted into the hall of entrance. With
many variations, suggested by the nature
of his building-materials, diversity of climate,
and a different mode of social life, Governor
Bellingham had planned his new habitation
after the residences of gentlemen of fair estate
in his native land.

Here, then, was a wide and reasonably lofty
hall, extending through the whole depth of the
house, and forming a medium of general com-
munication, more or less directly, with all the
other apartments. At one extremity, this spa-
cious room was lighted by the windows of the
two towers, which formed a small recess on
either side of the portal. At the other end,
though partly niuffled by a curtam, it was
more powerfully illuminated by one of those
embowed hall-windows which we read of in old
books, and which was provided with a deep
and cushioned seat.

Here, on the cushion, lay a folio tome,
probably of the Chronicles of England‚ or
other such substantial literature; even as, in
our own days, we scatter gilded volumes on
the centre-table, to be turned over by the

casual guest. The furniture of the hall con· .

sisted of some ponderous chairs, the backs of
which were elaborately carved with wreaths
of oaken flowers; and likewise a table in the
same taste; the whole being of Elizabethan
age, or perhaps earlier, and heirlooms‚ trans-
ferred hither from the governor's paternal
home.

 

On the table—in token that the sentiment -

of old English hospitality had not been left

behind—stood a large pewter tankard, at the ,

bottom of which had Hester or Pearl peeped
into it, they might have seen the frothy rem-
nant of a recent draught of ale.

On the wall hung a row of portraits, rep· ·

resenting the forefathers of the Billingham
