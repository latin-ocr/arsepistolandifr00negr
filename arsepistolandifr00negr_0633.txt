Ι shall sleep, and move with the moving ships, This woven raiment of nights and days,

Change as the winde change, veel· in the

fide;
My lips will feast on the foam of thy lips,
I shall rise with thy rising, with thee sub-
side;
Sleep‚ and not know if she be, if she were—
F illed full with life to the eyes and hair,
As a rose is full filled to the rose-leat tips
With splendid summer and perfume and
pride.

VVere it once cast off and unwound from
Naked {gil glad would I walk in my ways,
Alive and aware of thy waves and thee;

clear of the whole world, hidden at home,
Clothed with the green, and crowned with the

A pulsefoffllhe life of thy straits and bays⁷
A vein in the heart of the streams of the

sea.

KISSING ΗΕΒ, HAIR.

KISSING her hair, I sat against her feet;

lVove and unwove it—wound‚ and*

found it sweet;
Made sast therewith her hands, drew down
her eyes,

Decp as deep flowers, and dreamy like dim j

skies 3

With her own tresses bound, and found her ι

fair—
Kissing her hair.

 

Sleep were no sweeter than her face to me—

Sleep of cold sea-bloom under the eold sea:

What pain could get between my face and
hers?

What new sweet thing would love not relish
worse ’.Ρ

Unless, perhaps, white death had kissed me
there—
Kissing her hair.

Av MATGH.

F love were what the rose is,
And I nete like the leaf,
Our lives would grow together
In sad or singing mathew
Brown fields or flowery closes,
Green pleasure or gray grief ;
If love were what the rose is,
And I were like the leaf.

If I were what the words are,
And love were like the tune,
With double sound and single
Delight our lips would minglc,
With kisses glad as birds arv,
'shut get sweet rain at nomn ;
If I were like the words are,
And love were like the tune.

If you were life, my darling,

And I, your love, were death,
We’d shine and snow together
Ere March made sweet the weather
With daffodil and starling,

And hours of fruitful breath ;
If you were life, my darling,

And Ι, your love, were death,

If you were thrall to sorrow,
And I were page to joy,

we'd play for lives and seasons,

With loving looks and treasons,

And tears of night and morrow,
And laughs of maid and boy ;

If you were thrall to sorrow,

And Ι were page to joy.
