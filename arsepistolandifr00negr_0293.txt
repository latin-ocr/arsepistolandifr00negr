WENDELL Pmmps.
“The Silver-Tongued Orator.''

 

· χ GENTLEMAN talking.'' In this way has 0116 of our most
famous orators been described. He was a Massachusetts
man, a son of one of the first old Boston families, whose
stately mansion is still standing on the lower corner of
Beacon and lValnut Streets. It was here that Wendell was
born, 111 1116 531116 year that another great man—Charles
Sumner—came into a family that lived not far away, where the rear of

An indignation meeting was called at Faneuil Η311 by Doctor Chan-
ning, and many people were roused against this murder who had been
indifferent before, or even fashionably opposed to the whole movement.

until Mr. Α1151111, AttorneyGreneral of the State, arose and said that
