HANS AND FRITZ.

AN S and Fritz were two Deutschers who
H lived side by side,
Remote from the world, its deceit and
its pride ;
With their pretzels and beer their spare
moments were spent,
And the fruits of their labor were peace
and content.

Hans purchased a horse of a neighbor one day,
And, lacking a part of the θεῖά-05 they
Made aS ξ13501111 upon Fritz 1ο 5011011 0 10011,

To help him to pay for his beautiful roan.

Fritz kindly consented the money to lend,

And gave the required amount to his friend ;
Remarking-—his own simple language to
“ Βο1110111ἑο1ἶ vas bedder ve make us a note.'’

The note was drawn up in their primitive
wa ——

“ 1, Haus‚ygets from Fritz feesty 1011015 10-
day ''—

When the question arose, the note being
made,

“Vichb von holds dot baper until it vas
aid?'’

“You geeps dot‚” says Fritz, und den you
vill know

You owes me dot money.’'
⁴‘ Dot ish so:

Dot makes me remempers Ι haf dot to bay,

Und I prings you der note und der money
some day.''

Says Hans :

A mouth had expired, when Hans, as agreed,

Paid back the amount, and from debt he was

Says {iiiiii- “ Now dot settles us.'’
replies, “ Yaw

Now who dakes dot baper accordings by law? ”

“ Ι geeps dot, now, ain't it? '' says Fritz ; “ den

I always remempers you baid dot to me.''

Says Hans, “Dot ish so, it vos now shust so blain

Dot I knows vot to do ven Ι porros again.''
