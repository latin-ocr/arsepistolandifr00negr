THE WANTS OF MAN.
BY JOHN QUINOY ADAMs.

This celebrated poem was written in lVashington in August, 1841, in answer to a request
from a lady for a contribution to her album. Mr. Adam< was elected President in 1824. In

1830 he consented to act as Representative in Congress from his district in Massachusetts
and was constantly re-elected until 1848, when by a stroke of apoplexy, he died at his desk
in the House. He was born in 1767.

“ AN wants but little here below, thstt next Ῑ want, at hssaVy COSss,
Nor wants that little long.'’ Is elegant attire t
’Τίς not wilh mo eXssCtly 30, Black sable 'furS fOI' Winter’S frost,

But 'tis so in the song, And silks sor summer's fire;

My wants are many, :ind if told, And (¹:1shme1·e shawls, and Brussels lace
lvould muster many a seore ; My bosom's front to deck,

And were each wish a mint of gold, And diamond rins-{S my hstDdS ῩΟ grace»
I still should long for more. And rubios for my neck.

What first Ι want is daily bread, And then Ι want a mansion fair,
And canvas-hacks and wine; A dwelling-house‚ in style,

And all the realms of nuture spread F our stories high, for wholesome air—
Before me when Ι dine; A massive marble pile;

With four choice cooks from France, beside, With halls for banquetings and balls,
To ‹Iros-:s my (linner well; All furnished rich and fine;

Four owni-ses scarcely can provide With high-blood studs in fifty stalle,
My appetite to quell. And cellars for my wine.
