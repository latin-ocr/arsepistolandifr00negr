18 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW.

“ Still shall thy gentle presence prove its ministry of hope and love3
Thy tendet· tones be heard within the story of Evangeline ;
And by the fireside‚ midst the rest, thou oft shalt be a weleome guest.

“ 0 happy poet! Thine is not a portion of the common lot;
Thy works shall follow thee, thy verse shall still thy living thoughts rehearse3
The ages shall to thee belong—an irnmortality of song.”

The best-loved singer of the English race was born at Portland,
Maine, February 27tl1, 1807. His surroundings were calculated to
develop the poetica] instinct which appears to have been his birthright.
The old saying that ‘⁸' the poet is born ⁷' is as true in his case as in that
of any other. His genius was a gift, an inheritance that marked him in
very early life for the high position he afterward gained in the world of
literature. Like every person of genuine feeling, he carried the memories

one could well imagine would be the case, considering his flights of fancy
and poetical gifts. Having been invited to the chair of modern languages
at Bowdoin he visited Europe to prepare himself for the position. Every—

In 1831 he married Miss Mary S. Potter‚ a “ love '’ of earliest days. In
1833 he published a number of translations from the Spanish which were
well received.

Harvard College invited him, in 1835, to the chair of modern
languages and belles lettres, a most honorable appointment and one
unsought. He again visited Europe, but suffered great bereavement
in the loss of his wife who died at Rotterdam. The sorrow of that dark
trial found a fitting voice in the pensive cords of the “Footsteps of
Angels.'' In 1839 he published “Hyperion,'' a charming story of his
travels, and in the same year appeared his first volume of original poems,
entitled, “ Voices of the Night,‘’ which contains several short poems that
