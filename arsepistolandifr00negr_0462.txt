Ι cannot make him dead !
When passing by the bed,
So long watched over with parental care,
My spirit and my eye
Seek him inquiringly,
Before the thought 6011165 that——he is not there !

VJ hen, at the cool gray break
Of day, from sleep 1 wake,
With my first breathing of the morning air
My soul goes up, with joy,
To Him who gave my boy ; [there !
Then 6011165 1116 sad thought that—he is not

When at the day's calm close,
Before we seek repose,
I'm with 1115 mother, offering up 0111· prayer ;
&Vhate'er Ι may be saying,
I am 111 spirit praying

JOHN PIERPONT.

Not there ! -Where, then, 15 he?
The form I used to see
Was but the raiment that 116 1156 to wear.
The grave, that now (10111 111655
Upon that cast-off dress,
Is but his wardrobe locked—he is not there!

He lives 1 —In all the past
He lives ; 1101, to the last,

Of seeing him again will Ι despair 3

In dreams I see him now;
And, 011 1115 angel brow,

Ι 566 11 written, ‘· Thou shalt see me there l

Yea, we all live to God!
Father, thy ohastening rod

So help us, thine affiicted ones, to bear,

That, in the spirit land,
Meeting at that right hand,

For our boy’s spirit, though—he is not there! ’Twill be our heaven to find that—he 15 therei

 

NO'I' ΟΝ THE BATTLE-FJELD.
“To fall on the battlefield fighting for my dear country,-—that would not be hard.’'—T1m Nmonnons.

ΝΟ, no,—let me lie
O Not on a field of battle when Ι die!
Let not the iron tread

Of the mad war-horse crush my helmed head ;
Nor let the reeking knife,

That I have drawn against a brother's life,
Be 111 1111116 hand when Death

Thunders along, and tram ples me beneath
His heavy squadron's heels,

Or gory felloes of his cannon's wheels.

From such a dying bed,
Though o'er it float the stripes of white and
red,
And the bald eagle brings
The clustered stars upon his wide-spread wings
To sparkle 111 my sight,
O, never let my spirit take her ssight!

Ι know that beauty's eye

Is all the brighter where gay pennants fly,
And brazen helmets (lance,

And snnshine flashes on the lifted lance ;
Ι know that bards have sung,

And people shouted till the welkin rung,

In honor of the brave

Who on the battle-field have found a grave:

Ι know that o'er their 1101165

Have grateful hands piled monumental stenes.

Some of those piles I've seen:

The one at Lexington upon the green
Where the first blood was shed,

And to my country's independence led3
And others on our shore,

The “ Battle Monument '' at Baltimore‚
And that on Bunker's Hill.

Ay, and abroad, a few more famous still;
Thy “ tomb.’' Themistocles,

That looks out yet upon the Grecian seas,
And which the waters kiss

That issue from the gulf of Salamis.

And thine, too, have Ι 56611,

Thy mound of earth, Patroclus, robed in green,
That, like a natural knoll,

Sheep climb and 111111116 over as they stroll,
Watched by some turbaned boy,

Upon the margin of the plain of Troy.
