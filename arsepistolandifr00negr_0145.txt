A SIGHT IN CAMP IN THE DAY-BREAK.
SIGHT in camp in the day-break gray Who are you‚elderly man so gaunt and grim,

and dim,
As from my tent Ι emerge so early,
sleepless‚
As slow I walk in the cool, fresh air, the path
near by the hospital tent,
Three forms I see on stretchers lying, brought
out there, untended lying,
Over each the blanket spread, ample brownish
woolen blanket,
Gray and heavy blanket‚ folding, covering
all.

Curious Ι halt, and silent stand ; ’
Then with light fingers I from the face of the
nearest, the first, just lift the blanket ε

with well-grayed hair, and flesh all sunken
about the eyes?

tho are you, my ‹lear comrade?

Then to the second I step. And who are you,
my child aud darling?

Who are you, sweet boy, with cheeks yet
blooming ?

Then to the third—a face nor child, nor old,
yery calm, as of beautiful yellow-white
Ydiiiilgy inan, I think Ι know you—I think

this face of yours is the face of the Christ
himself ;

Dead aud divine, and brother of all, and here
again he lies.

 

DEATH GAROL.

OME, lovely and soothing Death,
Undulate round the world, serenely
arriving, arriving
In the day, in the night, to all, to each,
Sooner or later, delicate Death.

Praised be the fathomless universe,
For life and joy, and for objects and know-
ledge curious 3
And for love, sweet love; but praise! praise !
praise!

For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding
Death.

Dark mother, always gliding near, with
soft feet,

Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest
welcome 2

Then Ι chant it for thee; Ι glorify thee above

I bri'illlg’ thee a song that when thou must
indeed come, come unfalteringly.

Approach, strong deliveress!

Lost in the loving, floating ocean of thee,
Laved in the flood of thy bliss, O Death.

From me to thee glad serenades,
Dances for thee Ι propose, saluting thee ; adorn-
ments and feastings for thee;
And the sights of the open landscape, and the
high-spread sky, are fitting,
And life and the fields, and the huge and
thoughtful night.

The night, in silence, under many a star;
The ocean-shore, and the husky whispering
wave whose voice I kn0w;
And the soul turning to thee, O vast and
well-veiled Death,
And the body gratefully nestling close to thee.

Over the tree-tops I fioat thee a song!
Over the rising and sinking waveS‚ over the
myriad fields‚ and the prairies wide ;
Over the dense-packed cities all, and the

teeming wharves and ways,

vWhen it is so—when thou hast taken them, Ι float this carol with joy, with joy to thee O,

I joyously sing the dead,

Death !
