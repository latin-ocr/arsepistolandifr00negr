Highest Authority on Art.

²³ ῘῙ s* HE distinguished prose author and critic whose masterly works
⁹ l Ι have made a place for themselves in the literature of our day,
n ³2 ² was born in London, England, in 1819. His writings on art,
including “Modern Painters,'' “The Seven Lamps of Archi-
tecture,'' and “ Stones of Venice‚'' are brilliant in thought and
exceedingly forcible in style. Ruskin in his writings compels
attention. There is something striking in every paragraph. His
thought is of the highest order, his words ring like blows on an anvil,
and his marshalled sentences are like battalions charging in battle.

He published nearly thirty works‚ mainly on art and architecture,
and maintained his supremacy in this field of literature to the last. He
also contributed largely to contemporaneous literature. He was elected
Professor of Fine Arts at Oxford‚ 1869, and received the degree of LLD.
from the University of Cambridge in 1871.

Ruskin was an indefatigable worker. He always rose with the sun,
and much of his literay work was done before his friends or the rest of
his household were awake. He had the genius for friendship, and his
private correspondence‚ no less than his public, was large. He was
sometimes momentarily hot-tempered, and was not averse to the use of
strong language. But of the arrogance and intolerance often displayed
in his writings when he assumed the prophet's mantle, there was in
his private intercourse no trace. Died in 1899.
