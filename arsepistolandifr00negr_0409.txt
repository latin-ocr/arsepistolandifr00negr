These were made of stout logs piled across

The flames blazed up fiercely, their flicker-

Ε are told, truly enough, that goodnoes
does not always command good for-
tune in 11118 world, that just hopes

are often deferred until it 18 too late to enjoy
their realization, that fame and honor only
discoveraman after he 1138 8838811 to value
them: and a large and respectable portion of
modern fiction 18 occupied in impressing 111888
80118118880118 upon us. It is pleasant, never-
11181888, w believe that sometimes fate conde-
scende not to be 80 uninitigable, and that 3
cloudy and guety morning does occasionally
brighten into a sunny and genial asternoon.
Too long a course of apparently perverse 31111
0018380031118 3881118018 bewilders the mind,
and the few and fleeting gleams of compensa-
tion seem a mockery.

One source of the perennial 8113110 of Gold-
emith’ 8 ‘'Vicar of Wakefield” 18, Ι think, that
in it the dividing line between the good and
the had fortune 18 80 distinctly drawn. Just
when a man 1138 done 1118 01111081, 31111 311
seems lost, Providence steps in, brings aid
from the 111081 unexpected quarter, and kin-
11188 everything into brighter and ever brighter
prosperity.

It was somewhat thus with Hawthorne,
though the picture of 1118 career 18 10 118
painted in alower and more delicate tone
than that of Goldsmith's brilliant little can-
vas, Up to the time of publication of “ The

Scarlet Letter‚” 1118 8111811131 circumstances
had certainly been growing more and more
unpromising; though, on the other hand, 1118
inner 1101088118 life had been sull of the most
vital and tender 13111813811008. But the date
of 1118 first popular success in literature 3180
marks the commenoement of 3 worldly pros-
perity which, though never by any meane
splendid (38 we 811311 [11888011γ see), at any
rate 8111118811 to allay the immediate anxiety
about to·morrow's breed-and-butter, from
which he had not hitherto been free. The
three American novels were written and pub-
lished in rapid 8088888100, and were reprinted
in Eugland, the first two being pirated; but
for the 1381, “The Blithedale Romanae? two
hundred [10011118 were obtained from Messi-s. ’
Chapman and Han for advanoe 8118818. There
is every 183800 to believe that during the
ensuing years other 1111030888 would have been
written; and perhaps they would have been
38 good 38, or better than, 111088 11131 went
before. But it 18 vain to 8118801318 38 10 what
might have been. Tho production of such
books 38 “ Τ118 Scarlet Letter ’' and ⁴‘ The House
of Seven Gabloe '² cannot go on indefinitely;
though they 80810 10 118 easily written when
they are written, they repres-:ent a great deal 01
the writer’s spiritual existence. At all events,
it 18 better to write too little than 100 100811.
