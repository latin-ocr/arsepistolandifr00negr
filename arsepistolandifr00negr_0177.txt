NATHANIEL PARKER WILLIS. 135

the continent, mixing largely in society, and visiting every thing worthy
of his regard as a man of letters, or as an American, and his “ First Im-
pressions ’' were given in his letters to the “ Mirror,'' in which he de-
scribed, with remarkable spirit and fidelity, and 111 3 style peculiarly
graceful and elegant, scenery and incidents, and social life among the
polite classes in Europe. His letters were collected and republished in
London, under the title of “Pencillings by the Way,” and violently
attacked in several of the leading periodicals, ostensibly on account of
their too great freedom of persona] detail.

In 1835 Mr. Willis was married in England. He soon after pub-
lished his “ Inklings of Adventui-e,‘’ a collection of tales and sketches
originally written for a London magazine, under the signature of “Philip
Slingsby 3 '' and in 1837 he returned to the United States, and retired to
his beautiful estate 011 the Susquehanna, named “ Glenmary,'' in compli-
ment to one of the most admirable wives that ever gladdened a poet’s
solitude. Iu the early part of 1839 he became onc of the editors of “The
Corsair,'’ a literary gazette, and in the autumn of that year went again to
London, where, in the following winter, he published his “ Loiterings of
Travel,'' in three volumes, and “ Two KVays of Dying for a Husband,''
comprising the plays “ Bianca Visconti,⁷' and “ Tortesa the Usurer.''

In 1840 appeared the illustrated edition of his poems, and his “ Let-
ters from Under a Bridge,'' and he retired 3 second time to his seat in
western New York. Besides the works already mentioned, he is the
author of “ American Scenery,'' and of “ Ireland,’' two works illustrated
in a splendid manner by Bartlett, and of numerous papers in the reviews,
magazines, and other periodicals,

The prose and poetry of Mr. Willis are alike distinguished for ex-
quisite finish and melody. His language is pure, varied, and rich3 his
imagination brilliant, and his wit of the finest quality. Many of his de-
scriptions of natural scenery are written pictures; and no other author
has represented with equal vivacity and truth the manners of the age.
His dramatic poems have been the most successful works of their kind
produced in America. They exhibit a deep acquaintance with the com-
mon sympathies and passions, and are as remarkable as his other writ-
ings for affluence of language and imagery and descriptive power. Mr.

Willis died in 1867.
