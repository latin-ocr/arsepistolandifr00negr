BENJAMIN P. SHILL ABER.

And a box to that;
To one his dog,

Another his 631;
To this his buckles‚
To that his hat3

³ Till, through the long list of legacies run,

The name of the heir was lighted upon :

· When, 111 tonos like the tones of a bell

Thaee were the words from his will that fell :

; “And further, Ι, John

Have fixed upon,

John Smith the tenth, t› be my heir

¹ My houseto maintain and my honors to bear.’

⁴ Now, here was a stew

Or who the fortune had fallen to, ·

⁷ Tbey couldn' t tell, were they to be shot,

For fifteen J ohns were then on the spot;

They were sadly at a loss to fix upon.

Then 31167 argued the matter early and

! And lawsuits gathered‚ and feae flew free,

And jurles tried it and couldn't agree,
And fortunes were spent, till hope was gone,
In finding who was the favored John ,Ι
Β111 they found instead that it wouldn't pay,
And so in court they allowed it to lay,

⁴ To fill my place upon earth when I' m gone— 'In the dust and rust of years piled away.

A century is it 511166 ΜΓ. Smith died,

And his family name is scattered wide,

And towns have arisen upon his broad land,

Prosperity beaming on every hand ;

A factory hums o'er his old hearth-stone,

But John Smith the tenth one was never
known,

· And which was the tenth with the Ρ16ΒΧ1 And John Smith's will will' 111 chancery be
