HENRY WooorlN GRADY.
Far-famed for His Eloquence.

 

ῥα {Q R. GRADY, who was called “the rising star of the South,'' was
born in Athens, Ga., May 17, 1851, and died in Atlanta, Ga,
December 2 3, 1889. No written memorial can indicate the
ὅ “ Α strong hold which this young orator had upon the Southern
·. people. Although he died at the early age of thirty—eight, his
farne was world-wide, and there was perhaps no man in the
nation more honored and respected‚ both North and South, than was this
phenomenally gifted writer and speaker during the last few years of
his life, which was devoted to the broadest patriotism.

On the 2151 of December, 1887, Mr. Grady, in response to an urgent
invitation, delivered an address at a banquet of the New England
Club, New York, which attracted wide attention. This, and similar
speeches, did much to wipe out the prejudices engendered by the war,
bridge the bloody chasm, and draw the two sections into a closer union.
For Mr. Grady stood for that pacific sentiment, which, rising above all
party strife and clamor, seeks to unite, in feeling and purpose, all parts
of our common country,

He drew the admiration of the· men who differed from him, or at least
wished to differ from him, but found it impossible to do so when brought
under the power of his eloquent, logical speeches and his magnetic per-
sonality. For a few years—and alas 1 for a few years only—he was the
grandest leader we have known for a generation. His father lost his life
while fighting for the Confederate cause, but on the very grave of his sire
and on the total wreck of the family fortune, the son gave noble expres-
sion to a patriotism that embraced the whole country. He was too broad
and large for a state or a section3 he was the nation' s own man, and was
above all partisan bigotry

Mr. Grady graduated from the University of Georgia at the age of
‘seventeen; afterward attended the University of Virginia3 entered the
