THE DRUMMER BOY OF SHILOH.

N Shiloh’s dark and bloodly ground the I've loved my country as my G0d‚ to serve
O dead and wounded lay ; them both I've tried.’'
Among them was a drummer boy who He smiled‚ shook hands; death seized the boy,
beat the drum that day; who prayed before he died.
A wo-unded soldier held him up, his drum was
by his side ;
He clasped his hands and raised his eyes, and
prayed before he died.

Each soldier wept then like a child, stout
hearts were they and brave ;

The flag his winding sheet; God’s book the
key unto his grave;

“ Look down upon the battlefieffl, O, thou our They wrote upon a simple board these words:

Heavenly Friend; ‘⁴ This is a guide
Have merey on our sinful souls ; '⁷ the soldiers To those who’d mourn the drummer boy, who
cried Amen ; prayed before he died.'’

For gathered 'round a little group each brave
man knelt and cried; Ye angels 'round the throne of grace, look

They Πῗὲἓὲῗὲ ἱοθῖὲῗθέἴυωωθΐ boy' who prayed Who fggglil, [illifiln (tllileedbglssgfissoffs plain now

slumbering in their g1·aves;
“ Oh, mother,'' said the dying boy, “look down Ηο337 many homes made desolate, how many

 

from heaven on me 3 hearts have sighed,
Receive me to thy fond embrace, O take me How many like the drummer boy, who prayed
home to thee ι before he diedl
OLD GRIMES.

BY ALBERT GORTON GREENE.

The metrica] composition entitled“ Old Gri mes' ’is one of the lyries that do not go into
obscurity. Sung often m 1113 3ears ag„ 0 to ‘Auld Lang Sy ne,' 'it still suivives, and there are
few readers who are not familie r withD it Its author was yborn ln vaidence, Rhode Island

in 1802, graduated at Bro3311 Universit3 in 1820,a11d was admitted to the bar in 1834.

LD Grimes is dead, · that good old man He lived at peace with all mankind,
VVe ne 'er shall see him more: In fl'lendship lle WaS true ζ
He used to wer 1· a long, blaek coat, His coat had pocket-holes behind,
All button' d d033n before. His pantaloons were blue.
His beart was open as the day Unharmed, the sin which earth pollute&
His feelings all were true; He passed securely o’er‚
His hair was some inclined to gray— And never wore a pair of boots
He wore it in a queue. For thirty years or more.
XVhene'er he heard the voice of pain But good old Grimes is now at rest,
His breast with pity burned ; Nor fears misfortune’s frown :
The large, round head upon his eane He wore a douole-breasted vest—-
From ivory was turned. The stripes ran up and down.
Kind words he ever had for all 3 He modest merit sought to find,
He knew no base design : And pay it its desert:
His eyes were dark and rather small, He had no maliee in his mind,

His nose was aquiline. No ruffles on his shirt.
