and your Emerson smile icily at the sight
away with them! '’

“ Why, Nellie, you goose, Carlyleis ‘ a man
and a brother,’ in spite of his ‘Latter-day
Pamphlets,’ and no ogre. Ι believe heis
very well disposed toward babies in general;
while Emersou is as tender as he is great.
Have you forgotten his ‘Threnody,' in which
the sob of a mortal's sorrow rises and swells
into an immortal's paen? I see that baby is
very lovely: Ι think that Louise may well be
proud of her. It's a pity that she must grow
up into conventionalities and all that—per-
haps become some man's plaything, or slave.''

“ Ο don’t, sister!—‘ sufficient for the day is
the worriment thereos! But I think you and
Nellie are mistaken about the pride. Ι am
conscious of no such feeling in regard to my
little Florence, but only of joy, gratitude,
infinite tenderuess, and solicitude.'’

Thus the young mother—for the first time
speaking, but not turning her eyes from the
bath-tub.

“ Ah, coz, it won’t go! Young mothers
are the proudest of living creatures. The
sweetest and saintliest among you have a sort
of subdued exultation, a meek assumption, an
adorable insolence, toward the whole unmar-
ried and childless world. I have never seen
anything like it elsewhere.’'

“I have, in a bantam Biddy, parading her
first brood in the hen-yard, or a youthful duck,
leading her first little downy flock to the water.'’

“ Ha, blasphemer! are you there?'' eries
Miss Nellie, with a bright smile, and a brighter
blush. Blasphemer’s other name is a tolerably
good one—Edward Norton-—though he is
oftenest called “Our Ned.‘' He is the sole
male representative of a wealthy old New
England family—the pride and darling of
four pretty sisters, “ the only son of his mother,
and she a widow,” who adores him—“a likely
youth, just twenty-one,'' handsome, brilliant,
and standing six feet high in his stockings.
Yet, in spite of all these unfavorable circum-
stances, he is a very good sort of a fellow.
He is just home from the model college of the
Commonwealth, where he learned to smoke‚
and, I blush to say, has a cigar in hand at
this moment, just as he has been summoned ἱ

from the garden by his pet sister, Kate, half-
wild with delight and excitement. With him
comes a brother, according to the law, and
after the spirit—a young, slender, fair-haired
man, but with an indescribable something of
paternal importance about him. He is the
other proprietor of baby, and steps forward
with a laugh and a “Heh, my little water-
nymph, my Iris! ’¹ and by the bath-tub kneel-
ing, catches a moist kiss from smiling baby
lips, and a sudden wilting shower 011 shirt-
front and collar, from moister baby hands.

Young collegian pauses on the threshold,
essaying to look lofty and sarcastic for a
moment. Then his eye rests on Nellie Lee’s
blushing face, on the red, smiling lips, the
braids of gold, sprinkled with shining drops—
meets those sweet, shy eyes, and a sudden mys-
terious feeling, soft and vague and tender,
floods his gay young heart. He looks at baby
again, “ 'Tis a pretty sight, upon my word!
Let me throw away my cigar before Ι come
nearer; it is incense too profane for such pure
rites. Now give me a peep at Dian-the less!
How the little witch revels in the water! A
small Undine. J011y‚isn’t it, baby? thy,
Louise‚ I did not know that Floy was so
lovely, such a perfect little creature. How
fair she is? thy, her flesh, where it is not
rosy, is of the pure, translucent whiteness of
a water-lily.'’

No response to this tribute, for baby has
been in the water more than long enough,
and must be taken out, willy,nilly. Decidedly
nilly it proves ; baby proceeds to demonstrate
that she is not altogether cherubic, by kick-
ing and screaming lustily, and striking out
frantically with her little, dripping hands,
but Madonna wraps her in sost linen, rolls
her and pats her, till she grows good and

merry again, and laughs through her pretty
tears.

But the brief storm has been enough to
clear the nursery of all save grandmamma
and Auntie Kate, who draw nearer to witness
the process of drying and dressing. Then the
light golden looks are brushed and twined into
tendril-like curls, and lo! the beautifiil labor

of love is finished. Baby is bathed and dressed
for the day.
