JOSEPH RooMAN DRAKE.
Author of ‘⁶ The Culprit Fay.'’

 

York, on the seventh day of August, 1795. His father died
² · ἶν’, while he was very young, and left his family in possession of
but little property. Young Drake, therefore, experienced some
difficulties in acquiring his education. He entered Columbia
College, however, at an early period, and passed through that
institution with a reputation for scholarship, taste, and admirable social
qualities, all of which distinguished him afterward.

Soon after completing his professional studies he was married. His
health, about the same time, began to decline, and in the winter of 1819
he visited New Orleans, to which city his mother had previously removed.
He had anticipated some benefit from the sea-voyage, and the mild climate
of Louisiana, but was disappointed, and in the spring of 1820 he returned
to New York. His disease—consumption——was now too deeply seated
for hope of restoration to be cherished, and he gradually withdrew him-
self from society, and sought quiet among his books, and in the com-
panionship of his wife and most intimate friends. He lingered through
the summer and died near the close of September, in the twenty-sixth
year of his age.

He began to write verse when very young, and was a contributor to
several gazettes before he was sixteen years old. He permitted none but
his most intimate friends to know his signatures, and sometimes kept the
secrets of his authorship entirely to himself. The longest poem by
Drake is “ The Culprit Fay‚'’ a story exhibiting the most delicate fancy,
and much artistic skill, which was not printed until several years after
his death. It was composed hastily among the highlands of the Hudson,

in the summer of 1819. ,
Drake had the true poet's love of nature, and nearly all his pro-

ductions lead us delightfully through field and wood. His vision is
keen, his fancy finds ever varying opportunities to display its delicate
conceptions, and his verse is a joy and constant surprise.
