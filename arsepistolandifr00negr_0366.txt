Wmmm Wm.

Virginia's Erilliant Orator.

Ι J ILLIAM WIRT was the youngest son of an emigrant from
‘ Switzerland‚ and was born in Bladensburg, Maryland, on the
eighth of November, 1772. His father died while he was an
infant, and his mother before he was eight years old. He
then became the ward of an uncle, who placed him at a
grammar school. He began the study of the law, and in ·
1792 was licensed to practice, and commenced his professional career at
Culpepper Court House in Virginia.

He was now twenty-one years of age, with good health, a handsome
person, pleasing address, and great fluency in conversation and in debate.
In the winter of 1807 he was retained under the direction of President
Jefferson to assist the Attorney-General of the United States in the cele-
brated prosecution of Aaron Buri· for treason. The great Marshall
presided, aud the first lawyers of the country were engaged for or against
the prisoner. The question was argued in a manner worthy of its
importance. “A degree of eloquence seldom displayed on any occasion,''
said the chief justice, ‘⁴ has embellished solidity of argument and depth
of research.'’ .

It is generally admitted that the speech of Mr. Wirt was altogether
the most brilliant and effective made during the trial. He was master of
all the arts by which the attention is secured and retained. Oratory was
his forte as well as his favorite art. Every period, every gesture, every
look, was carefully studied. His principal speech occupied four hours,
and was faithfully reported, probably by himself. The occasion was
fortunate3 he exerted his best powers3 and made his reputation national.
As everybody knows, Burr was acquitted. Luther Martin's remark, that
the trial was “much ado about nothing,‘' is now admitted to have been
as just as it was happy. There was on the one side of the prosecution
little opportunity for reasoning, and certainly Mr. Wirt exhibited no
great ability in that way 3 but his speech served his own purposes, and

helped to secure the proceeding from immediate contempt.
