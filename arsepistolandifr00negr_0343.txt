PATRIOTS OF THE

“ BUGKEYE STATE. ''

FROM “OHIO IN THE WAR.’'

HE people who filled these regiments, and
made these Administrations‚ and fur-
nished these Statesmen and these Gen-

mals, merited more praise than all the rest..
They counted their sons and sent them forth.
They followed them to the campe. They saw
them waste in inaction aud die of diseasc.
They then saw them led by incompetents to
needless slaughter. Stricken with anguish,
they still maintained their unshaken purpose.

They numbered the people again, and sent
out fresh thousands.
with generous gifts.
stricken families, and made desolate live>-

beautiful with thc sweet charities of a gra· ¹
eious Christianity. They infused their relig· ¹

ious zeal into the contest, They held their

soldiers to be soldiers in a holy war; they ¹

truly believed that through battle and siege
and reverse, God was waiting, in his own good
time, to give them the victory.

They did not shrink when they found how
they had walked these paths oswal· with open
but sightless eyes, while unseen hands were
guiding them to ends they knew not of. After
a season the war came very near to each one

of them. Almost every family had in it oue
dead for the holy cause; by almost every

hearthstone rose lamentations and the souud
of weeping for those that were not.
came the voice of the tempter. Able sons of
the State, men foremost in her honors and
her trust, besought them to pause, declaret]

Then ’

jured them to save the blood of sonS, and
husbands and fathers. They spurned the
temptation. By a vote more decisive than
had been known in the history of American
electione they rejected the tempter. Thence-
forward the position of Ohio was as a watch-
word to the Nation.

It seems right that the history of such ser-
vices and such devotion should be specially
preserved. The State which contributed such
leaders in the Cabinet, such Generals in the
field, and an army of three hundred and ten
thousand soldiers to follow them, may be par-
doned for desiring her achievements separ-
ately recorded.

F inding them thus grouped together, those
who come after us may trace the career of
Grant, and Sherman, and Sheridau3 of Rose-
crans, Mitohel, McPherson, of McDoweH,
McClellan, Buell; of Gilmore, and Steedman,
and Hazen, and Schenck, and the whole host
of our worthies; of Stantonj and Chase, and
Wade: of Dmnison, Tod, and Brough‚ and
the two hundred and thirty military organi-
zations they sent into the field.

They may watch how by the aid of these
the army grew into shape and substance.
They may see how, following those, it was led
“always to honor, often to victory,’' and at
last to the glory of success. Then‚ contem-
plating this whole magnificent offering to the
National cause, they may come to say, with
something of the pride with which we, who
have seen these things with our eyes and heard
them with our ears, regard the noble State,
the graeious mother of us all, “This was

Ohio in the lVarst'
