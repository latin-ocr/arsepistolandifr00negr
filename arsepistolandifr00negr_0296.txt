THE OHARACTER OF WASHINGTON.

T matters very little what spot may have
been the birthplace of Washington. No
people can claim, no country can ap-

propriate him. The boon of Providence to
the human race, his fame is eternity, and his
residence creation. Though it was the de-
feat of our arms, and the disgrace of our
policy, Ι almost bless the convulsion in which
he had his origin. If the heavens thundered,
and the earth rocked, yet, when the storm
had passed, how pure was the climate that it
cleared; how bright, in the brow of the firma-
ment, was the planet which it revealed to us!

In the production of lVashingtom it does
really appear as if Nature was endeavoring
to improve upon herself, and that all the vir-
tues of the ancient world were but so many
studies preparatory to the patriot of the new.
Individual instances, no doubt, there were,
splendid exemplifications of some singular
qualification; Caesar was merciful, Scipio was
continent, Hannibal was pa-tient; but it was
reserved for Washington to bind them all in
one, and, like the lovely masterpiece of the
Grecian artist, to exhibit, in one glow of as-
sociated beauty, the pride of every model,
and the perfection of every master.

As a general, he marshalled the peasant
into a veteran, and supplied by discipline the
absence of experience3 as a statesman, hc
enlarged the policy of the cabinet into the
most comprehensive system of general ad-
vantage3 and such was the wisdom of his

views, and the philosophy of his councils,
that to the soldier, and the statesman he al-
most added the character of the sage! A
conqueror, he was untainted with the crime
of blood; a revolutionist‚ he was free from
any stain of treason ; for aggression commenced
the contest and his country called him to the
command.

Liberty unsheathed his sword, necessity
stained, victory returned it. If he had paused
here, history might have doubted what sta·
tion to assign him3 whether at the head of
her citizens or her soldiers, her heroes or her
patriots. But the last glorious act crowns his
career, and banishes all hesitation.

Who, like Washington‚ affer having eman·
cipated a hemisphere, resigned its crown, and
preferred the retirement of domestic life to

the adoration of a land he might almost be
said to have created ἶ)

“ How shall we rank thee upon Glory's page,

Thou more than soldier, and just less than
⁶)

All &1835 ehast been reflects less fame on thee,

Far less, than all thou hast sorborne to be1”

Such, sir, is the testimony of one not to be
accused of partiality in his estimate of Amer-
rica. Happy‚ proud America! The light-
nings of heaven yielded to your philosophy!
The temptatione of earth could not seduco
your patriotism.
