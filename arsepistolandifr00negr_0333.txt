WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS.

The white-cap waves come rocking‚ rocking
In the sun so soft and bright,

And toss and play with the dead man
Drowned in the storm last night.

I remember the burning brushwood‚
Glimmering all day long,

Yellow and weak in the sunlight,
Now leaped up red and strong,

And fired the old dead chestnut,
That all our years had stood,

Gannt, and gray and ghostly
Apart from the sombre wood.

Ι cannot sleep for seeing,
With closed eyes to-night,
The tree in its dazzling splendor,
Dropping its blossoms bright ;

And old, old dreams of childhood
Come thronging my weary brain‚

Dear foolish beliefs and longings—
I doubt, are they real again?

It is nothing, and nothing, and nothing,
But Ι either think or see—

The phantoms of dead illusions
To-night are haunting me.

GHARAOTER OF LINOOLN.

FROM “LIFE AND SPEEOHES OF ABRAHAM LINOOLN.”

Ο admirer, who speaks his praise, must
pause to conceal a stain upon his good
name. No true man falters in his

affection at the remembrance of any mean
action or littleness in the life of Lincoln.
The purity of his reputation, the greatness
and dignity of his ambition, ennoble every
incident in his career, and give significanee to
all the events of his past.

It is true that simply to have split rails,
and commanded a flat-boat, is not to have
performed splendid actions. But the fact
that Lincoln has done these things, and risen
above them by his own force, confers a dignity
upon them; and the rustic boy who is to be
President in 1900, may well be consoled and
encouraged in his labors when he recalls these
incidents in the history of one whose future
once wore no brighter aspect than his own

wears now.
The emigrant, at the head of the slow oxen

that drag his household gods toward the set-
ting sun—towards some Illinois yet further
west—will take heart and hope when he re-
members that Lincoln made no prouder
entrance into the State of which he is now
the first citizen. The young student, climb-
ing unaided up the steep ascent-—he who has
begun the journey after the best hou rs of the
morning are lost forever—shall not be with-
out encouragement when he finds the foot-

 

prints of another in the most toilsome wind
ings of his path.

Lincoln's future success or unsuecess can
affect nothing in the past. The grandeur of
his triumph over all the obstacles of fortune
will remain the same. Office cannot confer
honors brighter than those he has already
achieved; it is the Presideney, not a great
man, that is elevated, if such be chosen chief
magistrate.

It is not as a politician alone that Lincoln
is heard ofin his early career. After Stuart’s
election to Congress has dissolved their eon-
nection, Lincoln forms a partnership with
Judge Logan, one of the first in his profession
at Springfield‚ and continues the practice of
the law with rising repute. His character-
istics as an advocate are earnestness and sin-
cerityof manner, and direetness, conciseness,
and strength of style; he appeals at other
times to the weapons of good-humored ridicule
as ably as to the heavier arms of forensie
combat.

He is strongest iu civil cases, but in a crimi-
nal cause that enlists his sympathy‚ he is also
great. It is then that the advocate’s convie-
tions, presented to the jury in terse and
forcible, yet eloquent language, sometimes
outweigh the charge of the judge. Juries
listen to him and concur in his arguments3
for his truthfulness is known.
