EDGAR ALLAN ΡΟΕ. ’ 63

And a resolute endeavm, And the people—ah, the people—
Now—now to sit or never, They that dwell up in the steep!e‚
By' the side of the pale-fuced moon. All alone,
And who tolling‚ tolling, tolling,
Oh, the bells‚ bells, bells! In the niuffled monotone,
What a tale their terror tells Feel a glory in so rolling
Of despair! On the human beart a stone—
How they clang, and clash‚ and roar! They are neither man nor woman—
What a horror they outpour They are neither brute nor human—
On the bosom of the palpitating air! They are Ghouls:
Yet the car, it fully knows, And their king it is who tolls3
By the twanging‚ And he rolls, rolls, mlle, rolls‚
And the clanging, A paean from the bells!
How the danger ebbs and flows ; And his merry bosom swells
Yet the ear distinctly tells, With the paean of the hells!
In the jangling And he daucos and he yells;
And the wrangling, Keeping time, time, time,
How the danger sinks and swelle, ‘ In a SOl't Of Runiss rhyffle‚
By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of To the paean of the 116115-
the bells-- Of the bells;
Of the bells— Keeping time, time, time,
Of the besss, bens, bells. bells, In a sort of Runic rhyme,
Belle, bells‚ bells— To the throbbing of the belle—
In the clamor aud the clangor of the bells! Of the bens, bens, bellS,
To the sobbing of the bells3
Hear the tolling of the bells— 1 Keeping time, time, time,
Iron belle! [compellsz As he knells, knells, knells,

In a happy Runie rhyme,
To the rolling of the hells,
Of the bells, bells, bells,
To the tolling of the besss,
Of the hells, bens, bells, heus——
Reus, belle, bells,
To the meaning and the groauing of the bells.

What a world of solemn thought their znonody
In the silence of the night

How we shiver with affright‚
At the melancholy menace of their tone!
For every sound that floats
From the rust within their throats
Is a grean.

 

 

LENORE.

. When Poe was a student of the Academy at Richmond, Va„ a boy at this time about
. Sixteen years old, he was invited by a friend to visit his home. Poe found there au unusually
attractive and happy household. The mother was a beautiful woman, with tender heart aud
affectlonate disposition. She felt great sympathy and compassion for Poe on account of his
orphanage. Poe was deeply touched by the kindness of his friend's mother who died soon
afterward. He never forgot her gentle spirit. and this, in imagination‚ he embodied in a
younger person *of peculiar charms, and celebrated it in the poem of “ Lenore.’' This is one
of his finest productions and shows the better side of his character.

H, broken is the golden bowl, And, Guy de Vere,
The spirit flown forever 1 Hast thou no tear?
Let the bell toll ! Weep now or never more!
A saintly soul See, 011 yon drear
Floats 011 the Stygian rivel-3 And rigid bier
