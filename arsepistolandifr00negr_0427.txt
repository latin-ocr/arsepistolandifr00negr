CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER. 379

He wrote “ Back Log Studies '⁹ in 1872, and in this work revealed
that genuine home affection and fondness for domestic life by which he
was always distinguished. This work appeared first as a series in
“Scribner's Magazine‚'' and was not only admired for its wholesome
thoughts and sentiments‚ but for its elegance of style and choice use of
language.

Mr. Warner was always a friend and advocate of education, and
wrote many articles and lectures for the benefit of teachers in the higher
grades of mental culture. He was not especially gifted as an orator, his
manner being much more tame than the intellectual quality of his
addresses. But he always had something to say which was well worth
saying and worth remembering by those who heard it.

He was somewhat of a travelier. “ My &Vinter on the Nile ’' ap-
peared in 18763 “In the Levant '' was issued in 18773 ‘⁸ In the wilder-
ness '’ in 18783 “ Roundabout Journeys '' in 1883, and “Their Pilgrim-
age” 1886. His works entitled “Being a Boy’' and “How Ι Shot a
Bear,‘' are bubbling over with spontaneous humor. He became co-editor
of “ Harper's Magazine '' in 1884, and later compiled the best collection
of English literature we have ever had. Mr. XVarner died suddenly at
Hartford‚ October 20, 1900.
