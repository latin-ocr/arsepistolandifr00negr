UN ⁶? Now you bet you, I rather guess so.
But he’s blind as a badger. Wh0a‚
Pache, boy, whoa.
No, you wouldn't think so to look at his eyes.
But he is badger blind, and it happened this
wise:

We lay low in the grass on the broad plain

Old {gegis and I, and my stolen brown bride.

“ F0rty full miles if a foot to ride,

Forty full miles ifa foot, and the devils

Of red (fomanches are hot on the track

When once thoy stiike it. Let the sun go

Soontliibvrxy s‹›on,'’ muttered bearded old Revels

As be peered at the sun,lying low on his back

Holding fast to his lasso ; then he jerked athis

Anduigzssssng to his seet, and glanced swiftly

As a hurricane coines, crushing pnlms in his

Not a waiL not a word from a lip was let fall,

Not a kiss from my bride, not a look or low

Of love-note or conrage, but on o'er the plain

So steady and still, leaning low to the mane,

“Pull‚ pull in your lassos, and bridle to stoed, With the hee] to the flank and the hand to
