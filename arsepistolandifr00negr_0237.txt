MARIETTA HoLLEY.

Humorous Writer.

 

(ζ *=2⁸f“'j-ATURAL mirth and wit are evidently the birthright of Miss
Holley. She sees the ludicrous side of things wherever one
is to be found, and in the most agreeable manner presents it to
' her readers. It seems to be as natural for her to do this as it
is for a bird to sing or water to seek its level. Without appar-
ent effort, without anything that is far-fetched and with delight-
’ ful ease, she entertains us with the experiences of “Josiah Allen's Wife,’'

which have a distinct country flavor.

Miss Holley was born near Adams, Jefferson County, N. Y. Her
family for several generations resided in this locality and were industri-
ous, thrifty, reputable people. In her early years she began writing
sketches, little poems and essays, some of which were published 111 10631
papers, and gave indication of the future fame of the author. Her first
real literary venture was sending an article to “ Peterson's Magazine '² in
Philadelphia. She had been known under the pen name of “Jemyme,''
but now took the name by which she is best known of “Josiah Allen’s
Wife.‘'

It is said that her book under this name was refused by the American
Publishing Co., of Hartford, as not being worthy of publicatiou. A
member of the firm, however, thought differently and undertook to bring
it out, the result of which was a conspicuous success. By his encourage-
ment she wrote another work entitled, “ My Opinions and Betsy Bobbet‘s,‘''
which was issued in 1872. Since that time she has become so well known
that her works are in constant demand. “ Samantha at the Centennial ’'
was published in 1877. It detailed the humorous experiences of herself
and Josiah at the great exposition. Several additional works were issued
by her Hartford publisher, all of which commanded attention and have
had a good sale. “ Sweet Cicely, or Josiah Allen's Wife as a Politician,’'
appeared in New York in 188 5. .

One of her most remarkable successes is “ Saniantha at Saratoga,”
189
