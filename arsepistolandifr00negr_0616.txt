OLIVER GOLDSMITH.

He was extravagant, loved fine living, and rich clothes, his

charities were only bounded by his purse, and he haunted the gaming-
table quite as frequently 31111 with 35 constant ill-success as of old. In
March, 1774, he came to London, ill in body and harassed 111 mind, and

took to his bed.

He died 611 1116 4111 of April, ten thousand dollars in

(lebt, and more sincerely 1361661611 111311 any literary man of his time.
Old and 11111116 people sobbed 011 the stairs of his apartments, Johnson

and Burke ι1111617611, and Reynolds, when 116 heard 1116 news, laid down his
pcncil and left 1115 studio. He was buried in the Temple Church, and a

monument was erected 111 111111 in Wcsnninster Abbey, bearing an in-

scription by Dr. Johnson.

HOME.
FROM “THE TRAVELER.⁷’

UT where to find the happiest spot below,

Β tho ean direct, when all pretvnd 16
know?

The shudd’ring tenant of the frigid zone
B‹›l‹lly proelaims that lmppiest spot his own 3
Extols the treasures of his stormy sens,
And in his long nights of revelry and ease :
The naked 116611 1, panting at the line,
Boasts of his gohhn sands and palmy whw,
Basks in the glare, 61· 5161115 1116 Lepid wnve‚

 

 

And thanks his gods for all the good they
gave.

Η 1611 15 1116 pat.1iot's boast, where'er we roam,

llis first, best country, ever is at home.

And yet, perhaps, if countries we compare,

And estimato 1116 blessings which they share,

Though patriots fiatter, still shall wisdom find

Λ 11 eqnal portion dealt to all mankind ;

As different good, by art or nature given,

T«) different nations makes their blessing even.

 

AN ELEGY ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DEATH OF A MAD DOG.

GOOI) people all, of every sort,

Give 6111· 111116 my song3
And if yon siml it wond’rous short
It cannot hold you long.

In l‘slington ther«- was a man,
of whom the world might say

That still a godl y raee he ran,
thene’er he went 16 pray.

A kind and gentle heart he had,
To comfort frlcnds and f‹›es;

The naked every (lay he clad,
then he put 011 his clotheS.

And in that town a dog was found,
As many dogs there be,

Both mongrel, puppy, whelp, and hound,
And curs of low degree.

 

This dog and man at first were friends,
But when a pique began,

'l'he dog, to gain his private ends,
Went mad, and bit the man.

A round fron] all the neighborlng streete
The wandering neighbors ran,

And swore the dog had lost his wits‚
To bite 56 good a man.

The wound it seemed both sore and sad
To every Christian eye :

And while they swore the dog was mad,
They swore the man would die.

But soon a wonder came to light,
That showed the rogues they lied τ
Τ116 man recovered of the bite,
The dog it was that died.
