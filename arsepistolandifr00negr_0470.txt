Behold the chief who now commands,
Once more to serve his country stands—
The rock on which the storm will beau

Sound, sound the trum p of fame!
Let- NVashington's great name
Ring through the world with lond applause;

He governed in the fearful honr Ι And glooms obscured Columbia‚s day,
Of horried war: or guides with ease His steady mind, from changes free,

The happier times of honest peace. . Resolved on death or liberty.

GOOD NIGH'I'.
BY CHARLES T. BRooKs.

OOI) night, Sweetly sleep!
'so each wem-y, mil-worn wight! · Eden's breezes round ye sweep.
N ow the (lay so ⁸meetly 610363, O‘er the peace-forsaken lover
143161)- aching brow reposes Let the darling image hover,
Peucefnlly till morning light. As he lies'in transport deep.
Good night! Sweetly sleep!
Home to res-t! So, good night!
Close the eye and calm the breasn Slumber on till morning light;
Stillness through the streets is stealing, Slumber till another morrow
And the watchman's horn is pealing, Brings its stores ofjoy and sorrow;
And the night calls soffly, ‘⁸ Haste! Fearless, in the Father’s sight,
Home to rest ἶ ” Slumber on. Good night!

H ἶ a wonderful stream is the river of Time There‘s a magica] isle up the river Time,

As it 111113 through the realm of tears, NVhere the softest of 3113 316 playing,
With 3 faultless rhythm and a musical There's a cloudless sky and a tropical clime‚
rh yme, And a song as sweet 33 3 vesper chime,
Awl a hroader sweep and a surge sublime, And the Junffl with the reses are straying.

As it blends in the ocean of years!
And the name of this isle is the “ Long Ago,”

How the winton< are d rifting like ssakes ofsnow‚ And we bury our treasuroe there ,
And the sunonem like 1111113 between, There are brows of beauty and bosoms of
And the years in the sheas, how they come aud snow,
the)v go There are heaps of dust—oh! we loved them
On the rim-’s 11161131. with its ebh and its ssew, so—

As it glides in the shadow and sheen! There are trinkets and tresses of hair.
