Three corpses lay out on the shining sands For those who will never come back to the .
In the morning gleam as the tide went town ; “

O MARY‚ Go AND GALL THE OATTLE· HOME!

ί ζ MARY, go aud call the cattle home “ O, it is weed‚ or fish, 01· floating hair,—
And call the cattle home, A tress o' golden hair,
And call the cattle home, O’ drowned maiden's hair,—
Aeross the sands 0' Dee! '' Above the 11018 at sea?
The western wind was wild and dank wi’ fuam, Was never salmon yet that shone so fair,
And all alone went she. Among the stakes on Dee.''
The creeping tide came up along the saud, They rowed her in across the rolling foam,——-
And o'cr and o‘er the sand, The cruel, erawling feam,
And round and round the sand, The cruel, hungry ibam,—
As far as eye could see ; To her grave beside the sea ;

The blinding mist came down and hid the land: But still the boatmen hear her call the cattle .

And never home came she. Aeross the sands o’ Dee. [home

THE MERRY LARK.

HE merry, merry lark was up and singing, Now the hare is snared and dead beside the

And the hare was out and feeding on snowyard,
the lea, And the lark beside the dreary winter sea,
And the merry, merry 110118 below were ringing, And my baby in 1118 cradle in the ehurchyard

When my child’s laugh rang through me. Waiteth there until the bells bring me.

 

THE DAY OF THE LORD.
THE Day of the Lord is at hand, at hand ; Gather you, gather you, hounds of hell—-

Its storms roll up the sky : Famine, and Plague, and War:
The nations sleep starving on heaps of Idleness, Bigotry, Cant, and Misrule,
g01d; Gather, and fall in the snare!

All dremners 1088 and sigh ; Hireling and Mammonite‚ Bigot and Knave‚
The night is darkest before the morn ; Crawl to the battle-field, sneak to your grave,
WVhen the pain 18 801081 1110 child is born, In the Day of the Lord at hand.

And the Day of the Lord 18 at hand.

tho would 811 down and sigh for a lost age ’
Gather you, gather you, angels of God— of gold,

Freedom, and Merey, and Truth ; While the Lord of all ages 18 here?

Come! for the Earth is grown coward and old; True hearts will leap up at the trumpet of God,

Come down, and renew us her youth. And those who can suffer can dare.
Wisdom, Self-saerifiee‚ Daring‚ and Love, Each old age of gold was an iron age too,
Haste to the battle—field, stoop from above—— And the meekest of saints may find stern work

To the Day of the Lord at hand. In the Day of the Lord at hand. [to du,
