GEORGE GORDoN BYRoN.
Celebrated Poet.

George Gordon, Esq., of Gight‚ and his father was Captain
Byron, or, as he was popularly ‘ter1ned, for his reckless proflig-
acy, “ Mad Jack Byron of the Guards.’' The parents of the
poet lived unhappily together, and the heartless libertine who trans-
mitted so many failings to his son, squandered the property of the woman
he had married for her wealth, and reduced her to comparative poverty.
Economy induced Mrs. Byron to take up her residence at Aberdeen, in
1790, where her son was placed at school.

Her management of young Byron was anything but J udicious, and
111 her fits of passion, she even reproached him with the lameness of one
of his feet, a deformity, which, although trifling, was severely felt by
the sensitive poet, and even engendered many of his misanthropic views.
It was rarely that he alluded to it in a J esting way. In his youth, how-
ever, he was acquainted with a child who had a similar defect, and used
to say to his nurse, in the Scotch dialect, which he had acquired: “see
the twa laddies wi’ the twa club feet ganging up the high street.’' His
rambles among the Highlands of Scotland had a strong effect upon his
imagination, and probably kindled the spark, which afterwards bright-

ened to a flame. In one of his poems he says :

 

“ Long have I roamed through lands which are not mine,
Adored the Alps, and loved 1116 Appennino,
Revered Parnassus, and beheld the steep

Jove’s Ida and Olympus crown the deep;

But ’twas not all long ages' lore, nor all

Their nature held me in their thrilling thrall 3
The infant rapturo still survived the boy,

And Loch-na-gar with Ida looked o’er Troy,
Mixed Celtic memories with the Phrygian mount,
And Highland linns with Castallie's clear front.
Forgive 1116, Homer's universal shade!

Forgive me, Phoebus! that my fancy strayed;
The North and nature taught me 1ο 3(101·6

Your soenes sublime, from those beloved before.'’ 4 3
