FRANCES ΙΞ. Wrrrmm.
Eloquent Advocate of Reform.

„N every walk of life where it is possible for woman to d1splay
, her talents, her success has been conspicuous. Our country
.· has every reason to be proud of those members of the gentler
sex who have commanded attention in authorship, sometimes

part of the land, and was always received with the attention due to her
position and character and the worthy objects she sought to promote.
She was eloquent in the best sense of the term, very fluent in speech,
possessed of unusual tact, and was heard by multitudes who were in the
habit of affirming that they “did not care to hear a woman speak in

Throughout her life she never thrust herself into notice, but simply

 

embraced the opportunities open to her, and entered the field of usefulness
when she heard the call for service. She was born in Churchville‚ N. Y„
September, 28, 1839, and was educated at Milwaukee and the North-
western Female College at Evansville, Ill„ from which she graduated in
1859. She became Professor of Natural Science there in 1862, and was

principal of Genesee Wesleyan Seminary in 1866—'67.
