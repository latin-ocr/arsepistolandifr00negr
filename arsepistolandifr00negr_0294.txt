246 WENDELL PHILLIPS.

and seemed ready to go with Austin, when Wendell Phillips—-somewhat
known as an Abolitionist—began to speak, amid hisses that almost
drowned his opening words: “When Ι heard the gentleman lay down
principles that placed the murderers of Alton side by side with Otis and
Hancock‚ with Quincy and AdamS, I thought these pictured lips (point-
ing to their portraits, which hang upon the walls) would have broken
into voice to rebuke the recreant American, the slanderer of the dead.''

That moment turned the tide of the meeting—the people remem-

bered their object in coming together, they recalled the fact that a band
of ruffians had taken on themselves to interfere with America's glory—
the freedom of the press—had cried down the rights of humanity, and
had taken the life of their fellow-citizen in cold blood.

This speech turned the great current of thought in Boston, in New
England, and throughout the North. It also made the fame of Wendell
Phillips as an orator, and placed him as one of the foremost among the
anti-slavery leaders.

He now took up the cause with the most earnest of its workers, and
became Garrison's right-hand helper. For it he gave up his place in

society, his friendships, his wealth, his profession, and even refused to
vote, or in any way call himself a citizen of the United States so long as
its Constitution provided for slavery. He made himself poor for the
cause he worked in, and of what money he earned by lecturing he gave
all away that he could spare. The fame of his eloquence always drew
large audiences, and was an important money-aid to his society, to say
nothing of his great influence upon the minds of those who heard him.

‘¹ He had his faults, they said, but they were faults
Of head and not of heart—his sharp assaults
Flung seeming heedless from his quivering bow,
And needless striking either friend or foe,
WVere launohed with eyes that saw not foe or friend,
But only shining far, some goal or end.

“ That compassed once, should bring God’s saving grace
To purge and purify the human race—
The measure meted out he took,
And blow for blow received without a look,
Without a sigh of conscious huit or hate,
To stir the tranquil ealmness of his state.

“ Born on the heights and in the purple bred,
He chose to walk the lowly ways instead,
That he might lift the wretched and defend
The rights of those who languished for a friend,
So many years he spent in listening
To those sad eries of wrong and suffering.’'
