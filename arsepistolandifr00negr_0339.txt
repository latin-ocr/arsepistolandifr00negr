FRANCES MIRIAM WHITCHER.

But that wa'n’t his fault—he was so out o’
health for a number 0’ year afore he died, it
ain’t to be wondered at he dident lay up
nothus—however, it dident give him no great
oneasiness—he never cared much for airthly
riches, though Miss Pendergrass says she heard
Miss Jinkins say Deacon Bedott was as tight
as the skin on his back—begrudged folks
their vittals when they come to his house!
did you ever! why, he was the hull—souldest
man Ι ever see in all my born dayS.

If I’d such a husband as Bill Jinkins waS,
I’d hold my tongue about my neighbor's hus-
bands. He was a dretful mean man, used to
git drunk every day of his life, and he had an
awful high temper—used to swear like all
possest when he got mad—and I've heard my
husband say, (and he wa'n't a man that ever
said anything that wa’n’t true)—I've heard
him say Bill Jinkins would cheat his own
father out of his eye tecth if hc had a chance.
VVhere was I? Oh! “His widder to con-

When Parson Potter read it, he says to me,
says he———“ What did you stop so soon for? ’'
—but Miss Jinkins told the Crosby's she
thought I'd better a’ stopt afore I'd begun—
she's a purty critter to talk so, I must say.
I’d like to see some poitry o' hem—I guess it
would be astonishin’ stuff; and mor'n all that,
she said there wa’n't a word o’ truth in the
hull on't-said Ι never cared tuppence for the
deacon. What an everlastin' lie! Why,
when he died, Ι took it so hard I went de-
ranged, and took on so for a' spell th‘ey was
afraid they should have to send me to a Lu-
nattic Arsenal. But that's a painful sub·
ject, Ι won't dwell on't. Ι conclude as fol-

I'll never change my single lot—-
I think 't would be a sin—

The inconsolable widder o’ Deacon Bedott
Don’t intend to get married agiu.

WIDOW BEDOTT TO ELDER SNIFFLES.
FRoM “winow BEDOTT PAPERS.”

REVEREND sir, Ι (lo declare

It drives me most to frenzy,
To think of you a lying there
Down sick with influenzy.

A body'd thought it was enough
To mourn your wive's departer,

Without sich trouble as this ere
To come a follerin’ arter.

But sickness and affliction
Are sent by a wise creation,
And always ought to be underwent
By patience and resignation.

O, Ι could to your bedside fly,
And wipe your weeping eyes,

And do my best to cure you up,
If ’t wouldn't create surprise.

It's a world of trouble we tarry in,
But, Elder, don't despair;

That you may soon be nlovin‘ ag’in
Is constantly my prayer.

Both sick and well, you may depend

You'll never be for-got
By your faithful and affectionate friend,

PmsoILLA Poon BEDOTT.
