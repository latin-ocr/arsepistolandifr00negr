do you hear it? But Ι don’t care ; I'll go to
mother's to-morrow ; I will ; and what's more
I’ll walk every step of the way; and you
know that will give me my death. Don't call
me a foolish woman; 'tis you that's the fool-
ish man. You know Ι can't wear elogs;
and, with no umbrella, the wet's sure to give
me a cold: it always does: but what do you

care for that? Nothing at all. I may be laid
up for what you care, as I dare say I shall;
and a pretty ‹loctor's bill there'll be. Ι hope
there will. It will teach you to lend your
umbrellas again. Ι shouldn't wonder if I
caught my death: yes, and that’s what you
lent the umbrella for. Of course !

MRS. OAUDLE ΟΝ SHIR'I· BUTTONS.

HERE, ΜΓ. Catulle, Ι hope you’re in a you always try to put me down. You fly int-o
little better temper than you were this a fage, and then, if Ι only try to Spealg you

morning. There, you needn't begin to
whistle; people don't come to bed to whistle.
But it's like you; Ι can't speak, that you
don't try to insult me. Once Ι used to say
you were the best creature living: now, you
get quite a fiend. Dolet you rest? No, I
won't let you rest. It's the only time Ι have
to talk to you, and you &stall hear me. I'm
put upon all day long: it's very hard if I
ean’t speak a word at night ; and it isn't often
Ι open my mouth, goodness knows!

Because once in your lifetime your shirt
wanted a button, you must almost swear the
roos off the house. You ‹lidn’t swear? Ha,
Mr.Caudle, you don’t know what you do
when you’re in a passion. You were not in a
passion, weren’t you? Well, then, Ι don't
know what a passion is; and I think Ι ought
by this time. I've lived long enough with
you, Mr. Caudle, to know that.

It’s a pity you haven't something worse to
complain of than a button off your shirt. If
you'd some wives, you would, Ι know. I'm
sure I’m never without a needle-and-thread in
my han‹l; what with you and the children,
I'm made a perfect slave of. And, what's my
thanks? Why, if once in your life a buttou's
off your shift—what do you say “ah '’ at? Ι
say once, Mr. Cau‹lle; or twice or three
times at most. I’m sure, Caudle, no man's
buttons in the world arc better looked after
thau yours. Ι only wish I'd kept the shirts
you had when you were first married! Ι
should like to know where were your buttons
then?

Yes‚ it's worth talking of! But that’s how

won't hear me. That's how you men always

will have all the talk to yourselves: a poor
woman isn't allowed to get a word in. A nice
notion you have of a wife, to suppose she’s
nothing to think of but her husband's but-
tons. A pretty notion, indeed, you have of
marriage. Ha! if poor women only knew
what they had to go through! What with
buttons, and one thing and another! They'd

never tie themselves up to the best man in the -

world, I'm sure. What would they do, Mr.
Caudle ?-W hy, do much better without you,
I'm certain.

And it's my belief, after all, that the button
wasn‘t off the shi1·t; it's my belief that you
pulled it off, that you might have something
to talk about. Oh, you're aggravating
enough, when you like, for anything! All I
know is, it's very odd that the button should
bc off the shi1·t; for I'm sure no woman’s a
greater slave to her husband’s buttons than Ι
am. Ι only say it’s very odd.

However, there’s only one comfort; it can’t
last long. I‘m worn to death with your tem·
per, and shan’t trouble you a great while.
Ha, you may laugh. And Ι dare say you
would laugh! I've no doubt of it! That's
your love; that's your feeling! I know that
I’m sinking every day, though I say nothing
about it. And when I'm gone, we shall see
how your second wife will look after your
buttons ! You'll find out the difference, then.
Yes, Caud1e‚ you'll think of me, then; for

then, Ι hope, you'll never have a blessed but-
ton to your back.
