Of ruined shrines, busy and bright
As they were all alive with light ;
And, yet more splendid, numerous flocks
Of pigeons, settling on the rocks,
With their rich restless wings, that gleam
Variously in the crilnson beam
Of the warm west—as if inlaid
With brilliants from the mine, or made

Of tearless rainbows‚ such as span
The unclouded skies of Peristan!
And then, the mingling sounds that come
Of shepherd’s ancient reed, with hum
Of the wild bees of Palestine,
Banqueting, through the flowery vales 3—

= And, Jordan, those sweet banks of thine‚

And woods, so full of nightingales!

SUBLIME WAS THE WARNING.

UBLIME was the warning that liberty

Oh, liberty! let not this spirit have rest,

If deceit he a wound, and suspicion a stain,
