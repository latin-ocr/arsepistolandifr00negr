“ Ν ow,” said the old man, holding up a
finger and laughing in his peculiarly silent
manner, “you shall see fire fight fire! Ah's
me! many is the time I have burnt a smootly
path from wanton laziness to pick my way
across a tangled bottom.''

“But is this not fatal?'’ cried the amazed
Middlet0n; “ are you not bringing the enemy
nigher to us instead of avoiding it? ”

“ Do you scorch so easily ?—y0ur gran'ther
had a tougher skin. But we shall live to see;
we shall all live to see.'’

The experience of the trapper was in the
right. As the fire gained strength and heat

it began to spread on three sides, dying of
itself on the fourth for want of aliment. As
it increased, and the sullen roaring announced
its power, it cleared every thing before it,
leaving the black and smoking soil far more
naked than if the scythe had swept the
place. The situation of the fugitives would
have still been hazardous had not the area
enlarged as the flame encircled them. But by
advancing to the spot where the trapper had

kindled the graSS, they avoided the heat, and
in a very few moments the flames began to

recede in every1qu arter, leaving them enveloped
in a cloud of smoke, but perfectly safe from
the torrent of fire that was still furiously
rolling onward.

The spectators regarded the simple expe-
dient of the trapper with that species of

are said to have viewed the manner in which
Columbus made his egg to stand on its end,
though with feelings that were filled with
gratitude instead of envy.

“Most wonderful !” said Middleton, when
he saw the complete success of the means by
which they had been rescued from a danger
that he had conceived to be unavoidable.

“The thought was a gist from heaven, and l .‘

the hand that executed it should be immortal.”
“ Old trapper‚’' cried Paul, thrusting his
fingers through his shaggy looks, “I have

lined many a loaded bee into his bole, and

know something of the nature of the woods,
but this is robbing a hornet of his sting with-

“It will do-—it will do‚’' returned the old

man, who after the first moment of his success

seeined to think no more of the exploit. . . “Let ·

the flames do their work for a short half
hour and then we will mount. That time is
needed to cool the meadow, for these unshod
beasts are tender on the hoof as a barefooted
girl.'’

The veteran, on whose experience they all
so implicitly relied for protection, employed
himself in reconnoitring objects in the distance,
through the openings which the air occasionally
made in the immense bodies ofsmoke‚ that by
this time lay in enormous piles on every part
of the plain.
