528 SIR WALTER SCOTT.

No thought was there of dastard flight; Dissolves 111 silent dew.
Linked in the serried phalanx tight, Tweed's echoes heard the ceaseless plash,

Groom fought like noble, squire like knight, While many a broken band,
As seat-lessly and well; Disordered, through her currents dash,

Till 111161· darkness closed her wing To gain the Scottish land3
O’er their thin host and wounded king. To town and tower, to down and (1316,

As from the charge they drew,
As mountain-waves from wasted lunds, Tradition, legend, tune and song,
Swevp back to ocean blue. Shull many an age that wail prolong.
still from the sire the son shall 11631·
Τ11611 did their loss his foemen know; Of the stern strife, and carnage drear‚
Their King, their Lords, their lnightiest low, Of Flodden’s fatal field,
They melted from the field, as snow, XVhere shivered was fair Seotland's spear,
theu streams are swoln and south winds blow, And broken was her shield!

GHRISTMAS IN OLDEN TIME.

At Iol more deep the mead did drain ; Forth to the wood did meri-y men go,
High on the beaeh his galleys drew, To gather in the mistletoe,

And feasted all his pirate erew3

While wildly loose their red locks fly, And general voice the happy night
And dancing round the blazing pile That to the COttagQ aS the CYOWU,

They make such barbarous mirth the while, Brought tidings Of salvation down’
As best might to the mind recall

The boisterous joys of Odin’s hall. The fire, With well-dried logS supplied,
VVent roaring up the chimney wide ;
Α11(1 well our Christian sires of old The huge hall table's oaken face,

Loved when the year its course had rolled‚ Scrubbed till it shone the day to grace,
And brought blithe Christmas back again, Bore then upon its massive board
With all its hospitable train. No mark to part the squire and lord ;
Domestic and religions rite Then was brought in the lusty brawn,
Gave honor to the holy night; By old blue-coated serving-man ;
