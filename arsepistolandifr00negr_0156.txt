The doctor turned on him savagely ε

‘· Here, now, what do you mean by such
conduct as this? Playing us for Chinamen
because we are strangers and trying to learn!
Trying to impose your vile second-hand car·

THE BABIES.
At a banquet tendered to General Grant at Chicago, Mark Twain amused the company by

responding to the 10631 011 BabieS.

OAST :-“ The Babies—As they comfort
us in our sorrOWS, let us not forget them
in our festivities.''

I like that. We haven‘t all had the good
fortune to bc ladics; we haven't all been gen-
erals, or 110613, or statesmen ; but when the
10631 works down to the babies, we stand on
common ground, for we have all been babies.
It is a shame that for a thousand years the
world's banquets have utterly ignored the
baby—as if he didn’t amount to anything!
If you gentlemen will stop and think a min-
ute,-—if you will go back fifty or a hundred
years, to your carly married life, and recon-
template your first baby, you will remember
that he amounted to agood deal, and even
something over. You soldiers all know that
when that little fellow arrived at family
headquarters you had to hand in your resig-
nation.

It took entire command. You became his
lackey, his mere body-servant, and you had
to stand around, too. He was not a com-
mauder who made allowances for time, dis-
tance, weather, or anything else. You had
to execute his orders whether it was possible
or not. And there was only one form of
marching in his manual of tactics‚ and that
was the double-quick. He treated you with
every sort of insolence and disrespect, and the
bravest of you didn't dare to saya word. You
could face the death-storm of Donelson and
Vicksburg, and give back blow for blow ; but
when he clawed your whiskers, and pulled

He spoke as follows:

your hair, and twisted your nose, you had to
take it.

When the thunders of war were sounding
in your ears, you set your faces toward the
batteries and advanced with steady tread;
but when he turned on the terrers of his war-
whoop, you advanced in the other direction— >
and mighty glad of the chance, too. When
he called for soothing syrup, did you venture
to throw out any side remarks about certain
services unbecoming an officer and a gentle-
man? No,——you got up and got it. If he
ordered his bottle, and it wasn't warm, did
you talk back? Not you‚--you went to work

and warmed it. You even descended so far ·

in your menial office as to take a suck at that
warm, insipid stuff yourseff, to see if it was
right‚—-three parts water to one of milk, a.
touch of sugar to modify the colic, and a drop
of peppermint to kill those immortal hiccups.
I can taste that stuff yet.

And how many things you learned as you
went along; sentimental young folk still took
stock in that beautiful old saying that when
the baby smiles in his sleep, it is because the
angels are whispering to him. Very pretty,
but “ too thin‚”-—simply wind on the stomach, ’”
my friends. If the baby proposed to take 6. r
walk at his usual hour, 230 in the morning,

didn’t you rise up promptly and 16166111- - 3

with a mental addition which wouldn’t im-
prove a Sunday-school book much—that that
was the very thing you were about to propose
yourself? Oh, you were under good disci· Ἰ
