We offset the demand of the brewer and
distiller, that you shall protect their ill-gotten
gains, with the thought of these most sacred
treasures, dear to the hearts that you, our
brothers, honor—clear to the hearts that you
love best. Ι bring to you this thought, to-
night, that you shall vote to represent us, and
hasten the time when we can represent our-
selves.

Ι believe that we are going out into this
work, being schooled and inspired for greater
things than we have dreamed, and that the
army of women will prove the grandest sister-
hood the world has ever known. As I have
seen the love and kindness and goodwill of
women who differ so widely from us politically
and religiously, and yet have found away
down in the depths of their hearts the utmost
love and affection, Ι have said, what kind of
a world will this be when all women are
as fond of each other as we strong-minded
women are?

all society needed to make it altogether home-

As I look around and see the heavy cloud

who take 110 interest in these things, I just
think they do not half mean the hard words

WOMAN AND

ONGER ago than I shall tell, my father
returned one night to the far-off Wis-
60113111 1101116 where Ι was reared, and

sitting by my mother's chair, with a ehild's
attentive ear I listened to their words He
told us of the news that day had brought
about Neal Dow, and the great fight for Pro-
hibition down in Maine, and then he said:
“I wonder if poor, rum-cursed lViseonsin
will ever get a law like that? '' And mother
rocked awhile in silence in the dear old chair
I love, and then she gently said: “Yes,
J osiah, there’ll be such a law all over the land
some day, when women vote.’'

My father had never heard her say as much
before. He was a great eonservative; so he
looked tremendously astonished, and replied,
111 1113 keen, sarcastic voice: “And pray,
how will you arrange it so that women shall
vote?” Mother’s ehair went to and fro a

say to you, as the Apostle Paul said to his
jailer: ‘You have put us into prison, we

My brother grew to manhood, and soon
after he was twenty-one years old he went
with father to vote. Standing hythe wind0w‚
a girl of sixteen years, not at all strong-
minded, I looked out as they drove away, my
father aud brother, and as I looked Ι felt a
strange ache in my heart, and tears sprang to
my eyes. Turning to my sister Mary, who
stood beside me, Ι saw that the dear little
innocent seemed wonderfully sober, too. I
said: “Don't you wish that we could go
with them when we are old enough? Don't
we love our country just as well as they do? '’
and her little frightened voice piped out:
“Yes, *of course we ought. Don't I know
that; but you musn't tell a soul—not mother,

ι even ; we should be called strong-minded.''
