Much of Mr. Riley's popularity is undoubtedly due to the dialect ⁴
noticeable everywhere in his work. Often the same thought clothed in -

different phraseology would be comparatively tame, but by ‘the dialect
used it takes on a different complexion‚ and comes home to the reader -

with much greater force. For a time he failed to obtain any emphatic 2
recognition, but having been complimented by Longfellow and Lowell on ,

some verses he sent to them, he at once sprang into popularity.

LEONAINIE.

The following is the poem written in early life by Mr. Riley‚ which so successfully imitated k
the style of Edgar A. Poe as to deceive Poe’s biographers aud led them to attribute it to the

gifted author of ‘⁴ The Raven.''

EONAINIE—Angels named her; Only spake the little lisper
L And they took the light In the Angel·tongue;
Of the laughing stars and framed her Yet Ι, listening, heard her whisper—
In a smile of white; “Songs are only sung
And they made her hair of gloomy Here below that they may grieve you— ’
Midnight, and her eyes of bloomy Tales but told you to deceive you—
Moonshine, and they brought her to me So must Leonainie leave you
In the solemn night. While her love is young.’'
Iu a solemn night of summer, Then God smiled and it was morning.
NVhen my beart of gloom Matehless and supreme,
Blossomed up to greet the comer Heaven’s glory seemed adorning
Like a rose in bloom ; Earth with its esteem : ,
All forbodings that distressed me Every heart but mine seemed gifted ’
Ι forgot as J oy caressed me— With the voice of prayer, and lifted
(Lying J oy 1 that caught and pressed me there my Leonainie drifted
In the arms of doom 1) From me like a dream.

It 'pears like—mor’n any day I nearly In pint of fact, we’re allus home on Deeoration: v
