PUBLIG DISHONESTY.

CORRUPT public sentiment produces
dishonesty. A public sentiment in
which dishonesty is not disgraceful ;

in which bad men are respectable, are trusted,
are honored, are exalted, is a curse to the
young. The sever of speculation‚ the univer-
sal derangement of business, the growing lax-
ness of morals is, to an alarming extent, intro-
ducing such a state of things.

If the shocking stupidity of the public mind
to atrocious dishonesties is not aroused ; if
good men do not bestir themselves to drag the
young from this foul sorcery; if the relaxed
hands of honesty are not tightened‚ and con-
science tutored to a severer morality, our
night is at hand—our midnight not far off.
Woe to that guilty people who sit down upon
broken lawe, and wealth saved by injustice!

 

⁴ WVoe to a generation fed by the bread offrmnl,

whose children’s inheritance shall be a per-
petual memento of their father’s nnrighteous-
ness; to whom dishonesty shall be made
pleasant by association with the revered mem-
ories of father, brother and friend 1

But when a whole people, united by com-
mon disregard of justice, conspire to ‹lesi-aud
public credimus, and States vie with States in
an infamous repudiation of just debts, by open
or sinister methods; and nations exert their
sovereignty to protect and dignify the knavery
of the commonwealth, then the confusion of
domestic affairs has bred a fiend before whose
flight honor fades away, and under whose feet
the sanctity of truth and the religion of solemn

comgacts are stamped down and ground into
the irt.

THE WAY OF· LOOKING AT A GIFT.

HE other day, in walking down the street,

a little beggar boy—or one who might

have begged, so ragged was he—having
discovered that I loved flowers, came and put
into my hand a faded little sprig which he
had somewhere found. I did not look directly
at the scrawny withered branch‚ but beheld it
through the medium of the boy’s heart, seeing
what he would have given, not what he gave;

LL the sobriety which religion needs or
requires is that which real earnestness
produces. Tears and shadows are not

needful to sobriety. Smiles and cheerfulness
are as much its elements. When men say—
Be sober, they usually mean, Be stupid ; but,

and so looking, the shriveled stem was laden
with blossoms of beauty and odor. And if Ι,
who am cold and selfish, and ignorant, receive
so graciously the offering of a poor child, with
what tender joy must our heavenly Father
receive the sincere tribute of his creaturos
when he looks through the medium of his
infinite love and compassion!

when the Bible says, Be sober, it means, Rouse
up and let fly the earnestness and vivacity of
life. The old, Scriptural sobriety was effect-
ual doing; the latter, ascetic sobriety is
effectual dullness, and dullness is out of place
in a bright world.
