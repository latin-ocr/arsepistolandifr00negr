RALPH WALDO EMERSON. . 53

THE FORE-RUNNERS.

ONG I followed happy guides:
I could never reach their sides.
Their step is forth and, ere the day,
Breaks up their leaguer and away.
Keen my sense, my heart was young,
Right good will my sinews strung,
But no speed of mine avails
To hunt upon their shining trails.
On and away, their hasting feet
Make the morning proud and sweet.

Flowers they strew, I catch the scent,
Or tone of silver instrument
Leaves on the wind melodious trace,

Yet could never see their face.
On eastern 111115 Ι see their smokes

Mixed with mist by distant lochs.

I met many travellers

Who the road had surely kept,

They saw not my fine revellers,

These had crossed them while they slept.

Some had heard their fair report,

In the country or the court.

Fleetest couriers alive

Never yet could once arrive,

As they went or they returned,

At the house where these sojourned.
Sometimes their strong speed they slacken.
Though they are not overtaken :

In sleep theIr jubilant troop is near,
Ι tuneful voices overhear,

It may be in wood or waste—

At unawares 't is come and passed.

Their near camp my spirit knows
By signs gracious as rainbows.

I thenceforward and long after,
Listen for their harp-like laughter.
And carry in my heart for days
Peace that hallows rudest ways,

THINE EYES STILL SHINED.

HINE eyes still shined for me, though far

Ι lonely roved the land or sea:

As I beheld yon evening star,
Which yet beholds not me.

This morn Ι climbed the misty hill,
And roamed the past-ures through t

NOWS he who tills the lonely field
To reap its scanty corn,
What mystic fruit his 30165 yield
At midnight and at morn.

In the long sunny afternoon
The plain was full of ghosts‚

Ι wandered up, I wandered down,
Beset by pensive hosts.

The winding Coneord gleamed below,
Pouring as wide a flood
As when my brothers, long ago,

t Came with me to the wood.

How danced thy form before my path,
Amidst the deep-eyed dewl

When the red bird spread his sable wing,
And showed his side of flame—

When the rose-bud ripened to the rose—
In both I read thy name.

DIRGE.

But they are gone—the holy ones
Who trod with me this lonely vale,

The strong, star-bright companions
Are silent, low and pale.

My good, my noble, in their prime,
Who made this world the feast it was,
Who learned with me the lore of Time,

Who loved this dwelling—place ;

They took this valley for their toy,
They played with it in every mood,

A cell for prayer, a hall for joy,
They treated Nature as they would.
