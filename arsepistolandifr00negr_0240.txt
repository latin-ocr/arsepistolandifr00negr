A simplicity and touehing pathos characterize it and move

the heart of the reader, whilea tragic force enthralls his attention and ⁴

THE: VAGABONDS.

E are two travelers‚ Rodger and Ι.
Roger’s my dog :— come here, you
scamp 1
J ump for the gentlemen—mind your eye!
Over the table—look out for the lamp 1-
The rogue is growing a little old ;
Five years we've tramped through wind
and weather,
And slept out-doors when nights were cold,
And ate and drank-—and starved together.

We’ve learned what comfort is, Ι tell you!

A bed on the floor, a bit of rosin,
A fire to thaw our thumbs (poor fellow!

The paw he holds up there's been frozen‚)
Plenty of catgut for my fiddle,

(This out-door business is bad for strings,)
Then a few nice buckwheats hot from the

griddle‚
And Roger and I set up for kings!

No, thank ye, sir—-I never drink;
Rodger and Ι are excecdingly moral—
Aren’t we, Roger ?—see him wink!
Well, something hot, then—we won’t quarrel.

He's thirsty, too—see him nod his head?
What a pity, sir, that dogs can't talk!
He understands every word that's said—
And he knows good milk from water-and-
chalk.

The truth is, sir, now Ι reflect,
I've been so sadly given to grog,
Ι wonder I've not lost the respect .
(Here's to you, sirl) even of my dog.
But he sticks by, through thick and thin ς
And this old coat, with its empty pockets‚
And rags that smell of tobacco and gin,
He’ll follow while he has eyes in his sockets.

There isn't another creature living
Would do it, and prove, through every dis-
aster. ·
So fond, faithful, and so forgiving,
To such a miserable, thankless master!
No, sir l—see him wag his tail and grin!
By George! it makes my old eyes water! ,-
That is, there’s something in this gin
That chokes a fellow. But no matter!
