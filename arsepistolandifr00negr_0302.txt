RoeHARD HENRY DANA.
Poet and Essayist.

HIS distinguished author was born at Cambridge, MassachusettS‚
November 17, 1787, and was a son of Chief-Justice Francis
Dana. He was educated at Harvard College, which he left
without a degree in 1807, after which he studied law and was

admitted to the bar of Boston in 1811.
In 1814 he began to contribute to the “North American

Review,'' of which he became associate editor in 1818. His first poem,
published in 1821, was entitled “The Dying Raven.'’ In 1827 he pub-
lished a remarkable poem to which he gave the name of “The Buc-
caneer.'' It exhibits a high grade of talent and was highly commended
in “ Blackwood's Magazine '’ by Professor Wilson. “We pronounce it,''
he says, “by far the most powerful and original of American poetical
compositions. The power is Mr. Dana's own, but the style—though
he has made it his own, too—is colored by that of Wordsworth and

olerid e.'‘
C In g1833 he published an edition of his poems and prose writings›

including “The Buccaneer,'' with some new poems and essays which
originally appeared in “The Idle Man,'' a periodical issued in 1821-22.
“The Idle Man,’' says William Cullen Bryant, “notwithstanding the
cold reception it met with from the public, we look upon as holding a
place among the first productions of American literature.'’ Mr. Dana
was popular as a lecturer on Shakespeare in Boston, New York and
philadelphia. He died February 2‚1879, after an active, useful and

honored life.

 

 

THE PLEASURE-BOAT.

OME, hoist the saiL the fast let go! She shoots ahead ; they're all afloat;
They’re seated side by side ς The strand is far behind.
Wave chases wave in pleasant flow ;

The hay is fair and wide· No danger reach so fair a crew!

Thou goddess of the foam,
The ripples lightly tap the boat, I’ll ever pay thee worship due,
Loose ! Give her to the wind! If thou wilt bring them home.
