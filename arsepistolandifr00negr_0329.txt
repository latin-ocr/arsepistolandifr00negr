could have produced after he commenced his career as an author. His
novels have been very popular, particularly in the southern stateS, the
scenery and history of which, several of them are designed to illustrate.
They exhibit considerable dramatic power, and some of the characters are
drawn with great skill.

His “Southern Passages and Pictures'' appeared in New York in
1839, and he afterward published “ Florida,'' in five cantos, and many
shorter poems. They are on a great variety of subjects, andin almost
every measure. Among them are several very spirited balladS, founded
on Indian traditions and on incidents 111 the war for independence. His
style is free and melodiouS, his fancy fertile and inventive, and his
imagery generally well chosen, though its range is limited. He is
strongly attached to his country. The rivers, forests, savannas, and institu-
tions of the South he regards with feelings similar to those with which
Whittier looks upon the mountains, lakes, and social systems of New

England.

Mr. Simms was retiring in his habits, went little into society, and
kept aloof from all controversies; finding happiness in the bosom of his
family, among his books, and in correspondence and persona] intercourse
with his literary friends. He was a fine specimen of the true southern
gentleman, and combined in himself the high qualities attributed to that
character.

MOTHER AND GHILD

HE wind blew wide the casement, and
within—

Looked arehly on its world-the little imp,

It was the loveliest picture !—a sweet
child.

Lay in its mother’s arms, and drew its life,
In pauses, from the fountain--the white round
Part shaded by loose 1105505, soft and dark,
Coneealing‚ but still showing, the fair realm
Of 50 much rapture, as green shadowing trees
With beauty shroud the brooklet. The red lips
&Vere parted, and the cheek upon the breast
Lay close, and, like the young leaf of the

flower,
&Vore the same color, rich and warm and

And 5111111811110110 are beautiful. Its eye,
A full blue gem, most exquisite-ly set,

 

ς Α5 if it knew even then that such a wreath
³ XVere not for all; and with its playful hands

It drew aside the robe that hid its realm,

And peeped and laughed aloud, and so it laid

Its head upon the shrine of such pure joys,

And, laughing‚ slept. And while it slept, the

tears

Of the sweet mother fell upon its eheek—

Tears such as fall from April skies, and bring

The sunlight after. They were tears of joy ;

And the true heart of that young mother 111011

Grew lighter, and she sang unconsciously

The silliest ballad-song that ever yet

Subdued the nui-sery's voices, and brought
sleep

To fold her sabbath wings above its conch.
