dark maids of sigo, as they sung their low and
simple songs of welcome beside his bed, and
sought to comfort the white stranger who had
“no mother to bring him milk, and no wife to
grind him corn.'' Oh ! talk as you may of
beauty, as a thing to be chiselled upon marble
or wrought on canvas-—speculate as you may
upon its colors and outline—what is it but an
intellectual abstraction after all? The heart
feels a beauty of another kind—looking through
outward environments‚ it discovers a deeper
and more real loveliness.

This was well understood by the old paint-
ers. In their pictures of Mary‚ the virgin

mother, the beauty which melts and subdue-s
the gazer is that of the soul and the affections
—uniting the awe and the mystery of the
mother's miraculous allotment with the inex-
pressible love, the unutterable tenderness, of
young maternity—Heaven's crowning mirac-le
with nature’s sweetest and holiest instinct.
And their pale Magdalens, holy with the look
of sins forgiven—how the divine beauty of
their penitence sinks into the heart! Do we
not feel that the only real deformity is sin, and
that goodness evermore hallows and sanctifies

its dwelling-place?

 

THE: POOR VOTER ΟΝ ELECTION DAY.

HE proudest now is but my peer‚
The highest not more high ;
To-day, of all the weary year,
A king of men am Ι.
To-day, alike are great and small,
The nameless and the known ;
My palace is the people’s hall,
The ballot-box my throne!

Who serves to-day upon the list
Beside the served shall stand ;
Alike the brown and wrinkled fist,
The gloved and dainty hand!
The rich is level with the poor,
The weak is strong to-day ;

And sleekest broadcloth counts no more .

Than homespun frock of gray.

To-day let pomp and vain pretence
My stubborn right abide3

I set a plain man's common sense
Against the pedant's pride.

To-day shall simple manhood try
The strength of gold and land ;

The wide world has not wealth to buy
The power in my right hand 1

While there's a grief to seek redress,
Or balance to adjust

WVhere weighs our living manhood less
Than Mammon’s vilest dust—

While there’s a right to need my vote,
A wrong to sweep away,

Up! clouted knee and ragged coat!
A man's a man to-day!

THE SHIP-BUILDERS.

HE sky is ruddy in the east,
The earth is gray below,
And spectral in the river-mist,
The ship’s white timbers show.
Thon let the sounds of measured stroke
And grating saw begin ;
The broad—axe to the gnarled oak,
The mallet to the pin!

H'ark l—roars the bellows, blast on blast,

The sooty smithy jars,
And fire-sparks‚ rising far and fast,
Are fading with the stars.

hose.

All day for us the smith shall stand
Beside that flushing forge ;
All day for us his heavy hand

The groaning anvil scourge.

Upl-—up 1—in nobler toil than ours
No craftsmen bear a part;

We make of nature’s giant powers
The slaves of human art.

Lay rib to rib and bearn to beam,
And drive the treenails free;

Nor faithless joint nor yawning seam
Shall tempt the searching sea!
