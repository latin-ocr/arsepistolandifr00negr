,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.

And in this state she gallops night by night

Through lovers’ hrains, and then they dream
of love;

On courtiers' knees, that dream on court’sies
straight ;

O’er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on
sees ;

O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream—

Which oft the angry Mab with blisters
plagues,

Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted
are :

Sometimes she gallops o'er a courtier’s nose,

And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;

And sometimes comes she with a tithe—pig's
tail,

Tickling a parson’s nose as 'a lies asleep,

 

537

Then dreams he of another benefice:

Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier‘s neck,

And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,

Of breaches, ambuscades, Spanish blades,

Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon

Drums in his ear, at which he starts and
wakes ;

And, being thus srighted, swears a prayer or
two,

And sleeps again. This is that very Mab,

That plats the manes of horses in the night ;

And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hans,

Which, once untangled, much missortune
bodes :

This is the hag, when maids lie on their hacke,

That presses them, and learns them first to
bear,

Making them women of good carriage.

OVER. HILL, OVER DALE.
FROM ‘⁴ MIDSUMMER NIGHT‘S DREAM.²‘

VER hill, over dale,
Thorough bush, thorough brier,
Over park, over pale,
Through fiood, through fire,
I do wander everywhere,
Swifter than the moon's sphere ;
And I serve the fairy queen,

To dew her orbs upon the green ε

The cowslips tall her pensioners be,

In their gold coats spots you see ;

Those be rubies, fairy favors,

In those freckles live their savors;

I must go seek some dew drops here,
And hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear.

WOOLSEY'S FALL.
FROM “HENRY vnw

FAREYVELL, a long farewell, to all my
greatness!
This is the state of man: to-day he
puts forth
The tender leaves of hope ; to-morrow blos-
s
AndSOliIears his blushing honors thick upon
The iliiild day comes a frost, a killing frost3
And-when he thinks, good easy man, full
surely
His greatness is a ripening——nips his root,
And then he falls, as Ι (10. Ι have ventured,
Like little wanton boys that swim on blad-
This maldys’summers in a sea of glory;

 

 

But far beyond my depth : my high-blown
ride

At lEngth broke under me ; and now has
left me,

VVeary and old with service, to the mercy

Of a rude stream that must forever hide me. ,

Vain pomp and ghmy of this world, I hate ye:

I feel my heart new opened. O, how wretched

Is that poor man that hangs on prince's favors!

There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire
t ‚

That (gu-eet aspect of princes, and their min,

More pangs and fears than wars or women
have ε

And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,

Never to hope again.
