Rom—m JoNEs BURDETTE.
Celebrated Humorist.

⁷ f

HE whole country came to know “The Burlington Hawkeye
, , Man,” and his humorous paragraphs‚ playful sallies and keen
ἰ) ³ thrusts at “ stuff and nonsense '' were widely read and enjoyed.
The genius of wit must be a possession of Mr. Burdette, since
his career as a humorous writer has far outlived that of ordi-
nary writers in the same line.

He was born in Greensborough, Pa„ July 30, 1844, but early in life
removed to Peoria‚ 111„ where he was educated in the public schools. He
enlisted as a private in the Forty-Seventh Illinois volunteers, in 1862,
and served until the close of the war. In 1869 he became one of the
editors of the “Peoria Transcript‚'' was afterward connected with the
“Review,'’ and still later assisted in the founding of a new paper in
Peoria, which did not succeed. Subsequently he became associate editor
of the “ Burlington Hawkeye‚'’ and his humorous contributions to that
journal, being widely copied, gave him a national reputation. In 1877
he began to deliver public lectures, in which he was very successful, his
subjects being “The Rise and Fall of the Moustache,'' “Home‚'' and
“The Pilgrimage of the Funny Man.''

Several volumes of his humorous writings have been issued. He
was connected with the ‘⁴ Brooklyn Eagle '' for some time, and continues
to contribute much to periodical literature. He also occasionally preaches,
being a licensed minister of the Baptist Church.

an author's private life, yet so much of interest belongs to the domestic
and home experiences of many well known writers as to render a certain
amount of curiosity almost pardonable. Mr. Burdette has always taken
,his friends into close relations with himself, and no one could be more

companionable or free from restraint and lofty airs. ¹
It is known that for years he was the tender, watchful guardian and
helper of an invalid wife, whose frailty taxed his time and care, and

enlisted all the sympathy of his true and generous nature. A consider-
