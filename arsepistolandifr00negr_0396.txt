“A VISION OF FLORIDA.”
FRoM “A TALLAHASSEE GIRL.”

HE reader will remember a picture which
caused such a stir in Parisian art cirles.
It was called “A Vision of Florida‚'’
and was done in the highest and most com-
mendable style of the impressionist school.
It was a young girl, dark-eyed, black-haired‚
brown-faced‚ lithe, innocent, clothed in white
and dull scarlet, sitting on a rustic seat under
a huge, moss-hung, live-oak tree. In the
back ground there was a glimpse of an old
gray mansion with a ‹lecaying veranda and a
many-gabled roof.

A 1113’ste1·ious charm hung about the pietu re,
‹lefiving criticisni and captivating the imagin-
ation. One tried in vain to analyze the feel-
ing which crept over him as he contemplated
that sweet, happy, half-languid, half-insistant
face. It was somewhat the face of abeautiful
child just aroused from gentle sleep and won-
derful dreams. It half lingered with the recol-
lections of those dreams, it half inquired about
the present and the promise of the morrow.
Such a face will haunt one, such a form will
stay in one's memory and rob one of rest.

Lawrence Cauthorne chanced to come upon
the picture at the exhibition, and at once-
struck numh with a bolt of sorrow he had
fancied dead—stood breathless before it. It
was as if he stood on the lawn at La Rue
place, with Lucie sitting in the old favorite
seat before him.

The feeling came and passed, like a hot, hurt-
ful breath wafted from a malarious plaee; and
then he carefully examined the canvas as one
who is coldly critical. It was the work, as
the reader already knows, of Herman Willard.
It has made him famous.

Cauthorne and Willard seldom meet now;
they have, by a tacit consent, dristed away
from each other. Once they had a little talk
in which they mutually confessed the foolish-
ness of nursing the Tallahassee memory.

“We really missed getting inside of that
strange little world, after all,'' said Willard,
toying with a cigarette.

“I got too far for my peace of mind, I
fear‚’' replied Cauthorne.

“Why should it affect one’s peace of mind? ”
demanded Willard. ‘⁶ We dropped in there
like strange beings from another planet. She
looked cautiously and inquiringly at us; she
enjoyed us as somewhat new and interesting3
but she loved Vance before she ever saw us,
and she was, like a true, sweet woman, the
world over, faithful and loyal to her lord.
The thing has its touch of pathos, its paug, its
irony; but it also has the dewy freshness and
tenderness‚ and joyfulness of the old, old
story. It ended in a happy marriage. What

could be added? Is it not a perfectly rounded ,

poem? '⁹
