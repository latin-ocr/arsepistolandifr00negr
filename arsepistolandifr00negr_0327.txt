pleasure with which they will then recount
the steps of New England's advancement.
On the morning of that day, although it will
not disturb us in our repose, the voice of ac-
clamation and gratitude, eommencing on the
Book of Plymouth‚ shall be transmitted
through millions of the sons of the Pilgrims,
till it lose itself in the murmurs of the Pacific
seas.

We would leave for the consideration of y
those who shall then occupy our places, some
proof that we hold the blessings transmitted
from our fathers in just estimation; some
proof of our attachment to the cause of good
. government, and of civil and religious liberty;
some proof of a sincere and ardent desire to
promote every thing which may enlarge the
understandings and improve the hearts of
men.

And when, from the long distance of a
hundred years, they shall look back upon us,
they shall know, at least, that we possessed
affections‚ which, running backward and
warming with gratitude for what our ances-

 

THE MAJESTY OF·

T may be asked, perhaps, what can we do?
Are we to go to war? Are we to inter-
fere in the Greek cause, or any other

European cause? Are we to endanger onr
pacific relations? No, certainly not. that,
then, the question recurs, remains for us ,ἓ If
we will not endanger our own peace, if we
will neither furnish armies nor navies to the
ooeuse which we think the just one, what is
there within our power?

Sir, this reasoning mistakes the age. The
time has been, indeed, when fleets, and armies,
and subsidies were the principa] reliances even
in the best cause. But, happily for mankind,
a great change has taken place in this respect.
Moral causes come into consideration in pro-
portion as the progress of knowledge is
advanced ; and the public opinion of the civil-
ized world is rapidly gaining an ascendancy
over mere brutal force. It is already able to
oppose the most formidable obstruction to the

also to our posterity, and meet them with
cordial salutation, ere yet they have arrived
on the shore of being.

Advance, then, ye future generations! We
would hail you, as you rise in your long suc-
cession‚ to fill the places which we now fill,
and to taste the blessings of existence where
we are passing, and soon shall have passed,
our own human duration. We bid you wel-
come to this pleasant land of the fathers.
We bid you welcome to the healthful skies

We greet your accession to the great inherit-

, ance which we have enjoyed. We welcome

you to the blessIngs of good government and
religious liberty. We welcome you to the
treasures of seleuce and the delights of learn-
ing. We welcome you to the transcendent
sweets of domestic life, to the happiness of
kindred, and parents, and children. We
welcome you to the immeasurable blessings

it grows more intelligent and more intense, it
will be more and more formidable. It may
be silenced by military power, but it cannot
be conquered. It is elastic, irrepressible, and
invulnerable to the weapons of ordinary war-
fare. It is that impassable, inextinguishable
enemy of mere violence and arbitrary rule
which, like Milton's angels,

‘⁴ Vital in every part,
Cannot, but by annihilating, die.'’

Until this be propitiated or satisfied, itis
vain for power to talk either of triumphs or
of repose. No matter what fields are deso-
lated, what fortresses surrendered, what armies
snbdued, or what provinces overrun. In the
history of the year that has passed by us, and
in the instance of unhappy Spain, we have
seen the vanity of all triumphs in a cause
which violates the general sense of justice of

progress of injustice and oppression3 and, as the civilized world.
