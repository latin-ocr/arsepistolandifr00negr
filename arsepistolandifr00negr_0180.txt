THE STRANGER ΟΝ THE SILL.

ETWEEN broad ficlds of wheat aud corn ¹ And hear the peewee's mournful song ;
Is the lowly home where Ι was born3 But the stranger comes-oh! painful proof-—
The peach-trce leans against, the wall, His sheaves are piled to the heated roof.
And 1116 woodbine wanders over all ;
There is the shaded doorway still, There is the ‹n-ehard—the very trees

But a stranger's foot, has crossed the sill. xVhffl‘ss my ChildhOOd knew lOssg hours Of 0883,
And watched the shadowy momente run

There is the barn—and, as of yore, Till my life imbibed more shade than sun :

Ι cau smell the hay from 1116 open door, The swing from 1116 bough still sweeps the air,

And see 1116 busy swallow's throng, But the stranger’s children are swinging there. ’
