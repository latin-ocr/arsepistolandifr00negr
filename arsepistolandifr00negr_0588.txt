«ΕΑ f} HIS eminent author was born in Calcutta‚ India, July 18, 1811,
‘ , ’ and was descended from an ancient family of Yorkshire. When

he was only five years old he was sent to England to be edu-
cated. As a young man his life seems to have lacked definite
purpose. He spent some years at Cambridge, but never grad-
uated3 he then studied on the continent, and especially in
Italy, with the idea of becoming a painter.

In 18 31 he began reading law, but in 1832 he abandoned London for
Paris. In 1837, having lost his modest fortune, he began to devote him-
self wholly to literature. Not until 1848, with the publication of “Vanity
Fair,'' did he become a literary celebrity. His succeeding novels also
proved popular and for a time he rivalled Dickens in public favor.

In 18 52, and again in 185 5-6, he lectured in the United States, and
in 18 57 was the unsuccessful liberal parliamentary candidate for Oxford.
In 18 57 he founded the “Cornhill Magazine,'' but he resigned the editor-
ship in 1862. He died in London, December 24, 1863. A marble bust
to his memory stands in NVestminister Abbey, and his name is recorded
there with those of his country’s most eminent men.

Another account of Mr. Thackeray says: “ Having inherited from
his father a considerable fortune, and not being compelled to labor for his
own livelihood, he chose the profession of an artist, but soon turned his

attention to literature.
“ For many years he was a contributor to ‘ Punch,’ and other periodi-

cals, and gained great popularity. His works of fiction rivalled those of
Dickens in popular favor, which is praise enough to be bestowed on any
writer. One of his best and most popular works is ‘Vanity Fai1·‚a Novel
without a Hero 3 ' another is entitled ‘ Pendennis.' He visited the United
States in 1852 and was very popular as a lecturer in all parts of the Union.
Returning to England, he wrote the ‘ Virginians,' which is considered one
of his best works of fiction. He left several daughters, some of whom

have inherited their father‘s literary tastes and abilities.''
