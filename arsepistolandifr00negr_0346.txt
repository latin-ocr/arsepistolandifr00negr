And the next that I remember, it started in a T hcre’s a little hard money besides, that's

But for full a week it lasted and neither of A couple of hundred dollars laid by for a

And thelnext was when Ι fretted because she

broke a bowl ;
And she said Ι was mean and stingy, and

hadn't any soul.

And so the thing kept workin', and all the

sels-same way;

Always somethin’ to ar’ge and something
sharp to say,-

And down on us came the neighb0rs‚ a couple
o’ dozen strong,

And lent their kindest service to help the

thing along.

And there have been days together-—and
many a weary week—
then both of us were cross and spunky, and

both too proud to speak ;
And Ι have been thinkin' and thinkin', the

whole of the summer and fall. ’
If Ι can't live kind with a woman, why then
I won’t at all.

And so I've talked with Betsy, and Betsy has
talked with me;

And we have agreed together that we can
never agree ;

And what is hers shall be hers, and what is
mine shall be mine ;

And 1'11 put it in the agreement, and take it
to her to sign.

Write on the paper, lawyer-the very first
paragraph—

And it’s nothin’ more than justice that Betsy

has her pay.

Give her the house and homestead ; a man

But women are wretched critters‚ unless they

And Ι have always determined‚ and never

failed to say,
That Betsy never should want a home, if Ι

Ι see that you are smiling, sir, at my givin'

Yes, divorce is cheap, sir, but Ι take no stock
in such ;

True and fair Ι married her, when she was
hlythe and young,

And Betsy was always good to me exceptin’
with her tongue.

When Ι was young as you, sir, and not so
sinart, perhaps,

For me she mittened a lawyer, and several
other chaps;

And all of ’em was flustered, and fairly taken

And for a time Ι was counted the luckiest

man in town.

Once when Ι had a sever—I won’t forget it
soon—
Ι was hot as a basted turkey and crazy as a

loon—

Never an hour went by me when she was out
Of sight ;

She nursed me true and tender, and stuck to

And if ever a house was tidy, and ever a

Exceptin’ when we've quarreled, and told

So draw up the paper, lawyer3 and I'll go
home to-night‚

And read the agreement t0 her, and see if
it’s all right;

And then in the morning I'll sell to a tradin'

And kiss the child that was left to us,and out
