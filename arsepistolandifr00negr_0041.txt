HENRY WADSWORTH LO NGFELLOW. 23

He needs must think of her once more,
How in the grave she lies ;

And with his hard rough hand he wipes
A tear out of his eyes.

ToiHng, rejoicing, sorrowing,
Onward through life 116 goes:

Each morning sees some task begin,
Eaeh evening sees it close ;

Something attempted, something done,
Has earned a night's repose.

Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,
For the lesson thou hast taught!

Thus at the flaming forge of life
Our fortunes must be wrought ;

Thus 011 its sounding anvil shaped
Each burning deed and thought!

THE OLD GLOGK ΟΝ THE STAIRS.

OMEWHAT back from the village street But, like the skeleton at the feast,

Stands the old-fashioned country—seat.

Across its antique portico
Tall poplar trees their shadows throw ;
And from its station in the hall
An ancient timepiece says to all:
“ Forever—never !
Never—forever 1 ’'

Half-way up the stairs it stands,

And points and beckons with its hands

From its case of massive oak,

Like a monk, who, under his cloak,

Crosses himself, and sighs, alas 1

With sorrowful voice to all who pass:
“ F orever——never 1
Never—forever 1 ”

By day its voice is low and light3

But in the silent dead of night

Distinet as a passing footstep’s sall,

It echoes along the vacant hall,

Along the ceiling, along the floor,

And seems to say at each chamber-door :
“ F orever—never 1
Never—forever ! '⁷

Through days of sorrow and of mirth,
Through days of death and days of birth,
Through every swift vicissitude
Of changeful time unchanged it has stood,
And as if, like God, it all things saw,
It calmly repeats those words of awe :
“ Forever—never 1
Never—forever l ''

In that mansion used to be
Free-hearted hospitality ;

His great fires up the chimney roared :
The stranger feasted at his board ;

T hat warning timepiece never ceased :
“ Forever—never 1
Never—forever 1 ''

There groups of merry children played,
There youths and maidens dreaming strayed;
O precious hours! Ο golden prime,
And affluence of love and time!
Even as a miser counts his gold,
Those hours the ancient timepiece told :

“ Forever—never 1

Never—forever 1 ”

From that chamber‚ clothed in white,
The bride came forth on her wedding night:
There, in that silent 100111 below,
The dead lay in his shroud of snow ;
And in the hush that followed the prayer
lVas heard the old clock 011 1116 stair:

‘⁴ Forever—never !

Never—forever 1 ”

All are scattered now and fied,

Some are married, some are dead ;

And when I ask, with throbs of pain,

“ Ah! when shall they all meet again? ’'

As in the days long since gone by,

The ancient timepiece makes reply:
“ F orever—never !
Never—forever 1 ”

Never here, forever there,
VVhere all parting, pain and care,
And death and time shall disappear—
Forever there, but never here 1
The horologe of eternity
Sayeth t-his incessantly:
“ Forever—never 1
Never—forever 1 '⁹
