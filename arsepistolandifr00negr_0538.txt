What do we give to our beloved?

A little faith all undisproved,
A little dust to overweep,

And bitter meinories to make

The whole earth blasted for our sake,—
He giveth his beloved sleep.

“Sleep sost, beloved ! '³ we sometimes say,
But have no tune to eharm away

But never doleful dream again
Shall break his happy slumber when
He giveth his beloved sleep.

O earth, sa> full of dreary noises!

O 1nen, with wailing in your voices!
O delved gold, the wailers heap!

O strife and curse that o'er it fall!

God strikes a silence through you all,
He giveth his beloved sleep.

His ‹lews drop mutely on the hill ;
His cloud above it saileth still,
T hough on its slope men sow and reap ·

ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.

Sad dreams that through the eyelids ereep ; Ι I thmk thelr happy smne IS heard

More softly than the dew is shed,
Or cloud is floated overhead,
He giveth his beloved sleep.

Ay, men may wonder while they scau

A living, thinking, feeling man
Confirmed in such a rest to keep3

But angels say—and through the word

He giveth his beloved sleep!

For me my beart, that erst did go
Most like a tired child at a show,
That sees through tears the mummers leap
Would now its wearied vision close,
Would childlike on His ‘love repose
Who giveth his beloved sleep.

 

And friends, dear friends, when it shall be
That this low breath is gone from me,
And round my bier ye come to weep,
Let One most loving of you all
Say, “ Not a tear must o'er her fall;
He giveth his beloved sleep.''

THREE KISSES.

FROM THE PORTUGUESE.

IRST time he kissed me, he but only kissed

The fingers of this hand wherewith Ι
write3

And, ever since, it grew more clean and
white,

Slow to world-greetings, quiek with its “O
list!’'

When the angels speak. A ring of amethyst
Ι could not wear here, plainer to my sight,
Than that first kiss. The second passed in

height

 

The first, and sought the forehead‚ and half
missed‚

Half falling on the hair. Oh, beyond meed!
That was the chrism of love, which love's
own erown,
With sanetifyi'ng sweetness, did precede.
The third upon my lips was folded down

In perfect, purple state; since when, indeed,
Ι have been proud, and said, “ Mylove, my
own 1 ''

A WOMAN’S QUESTION.

DO you know you have asked for the eost· Do you know you have asked for this prieeless

licst thing—
Ever made by the hand above—-
A woman's heart, and a woman’s life,
And a woman’s wonderful love?

As atgslffi might ask for a toy?
Demanding what others have died to wiri,—
With the reekless dash of a boy.
