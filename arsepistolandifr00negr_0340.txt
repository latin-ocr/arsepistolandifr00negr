information and of decided force of character. She was the
,- Ι daughter of Timothy Rice and was born in Boston, Mass.,
fs μ December 19, 1821. She is of Welsh descent and her father
‚⁴ was an active fighter in the navy in the war of 1812. Her
mother was a descendent of a well-known English family.

The girl received a thorough education in the Boston public schools,
then graduated at a female seminary at Charlestown, Mass, and acquired,
in addition to what an ordinary girl would get, 3 thorough classical
education. She was then engaged as a teacher to go to Virginia, and
among her duties was the teaching of a lot of slaves attached to a planta-
tion. She came back a pronounced abolitionist.

She taught in a private school near Boston on her return, but had
acquired the gift of talking in public and utilized that power for talking
against slavery and the slave trade. 1111845 she had become the wife of
the Rev. E. P. Livermore, a Universalist minister, and their tastes and
aims being similar, they worked together happily and effectively. In
18 57 the couple moved to Chicago, where Mrs. Livermore assisted her hus-
band in the publication of the Universalist organ for the Mississippi valley.

She was earnest in all that pertained to assisting the Union troops
during the war, and made a most creditable record, which was widely
recognized. After the war Μ15. Livermore was associated with the
woman suffrage movement in the United States. She is the author of a
number of works, among which may be mentioned, “What Shall We
Do With Our Daughters?'‘ and a number of articles in the “ Arena,'' ’
1110 “ Chautauquan,'' the “ Christian Advocate,’‘ and ‘⁴ Woman’s Journal.’‘

Mrs. Livermore's natural character is that of a practical philan-
thropist. Her early life was such as to qualify her to sympathize with
the poor, the down—trodden and unfortunate. Her gifts, both of pen and

tongue, have made her one of the most noted women of America.
