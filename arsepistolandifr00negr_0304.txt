MARY AssloAlt DoDGE.
Whose Pen-Name is “Gail Hamilton.”

 

  
     

CXISS DODGE is a striking example of an author who can write q

5 much without dilution, without descending into commonplaces,
⁷ , and who can pursue a long career of literary effort without
a incurring the criticism of failure. She was a woman of un-
usual strength of mind, great industry‚ and resolution in
grappling with the foremost questions of the day. Not that
she aspired to be a reformer‚ but no popular question was left untouched
by her vigorous pen, and it must be admitted that a good, hard, womanly
sense is shown in nearly all of her writings. Her facility in the use of
the pen was one of her characteristics.

She was born in Hamilton, Massachusetts‚ about 1838. It will be
readily seen that one part of her pen-name is the town in which she was

was a cousin of the eminent statesman, James G. Blaine, was associated
with him more or less in literary work, and after his death wrote and
edited his biography‚ a work of rare merit, and one which is the chief
authority upon the life and public services of Mr. Blaine. Her death
occurred not long after finishing the biography of one of the foremost of
modern Americans.

Thinking‚‘' published in 18623 “Gala Days,” in 1863 ; “A New Atmos- ,

ington in 1896.

Miss Dodge had acknowledged merit as a writer. She saw distinctly
her aim, and, without turning aside, pressed toward it with the full vigor

of strong intellect sharpened by extensive culture. If it can be said that
