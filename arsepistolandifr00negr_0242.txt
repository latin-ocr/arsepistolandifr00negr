DIRGE FOR A YOUNG GIRL.

NDERNEATH the sod low—lying‚ WVhen the summer moon is shining
Dark and drear, Soft and fair,
Sleepeth one who left in dying, Friends she loved in tears are twining
Sorrow here. Chaplets there.
Yes, they’re ever bending o’er her Rest in peace, thou gentle spirit,
Eyes that weep ; Throned above,—
Forms, that to the cold grave bore her, Souls like thine with God inherit
Vigils keep. Life and love!

THE NANTUOKET SKJPPER.

ANY a long, long year ago, A skipper gray, whose eyes were dim,

Nantucket skippers had a plan Could tell, by tasting, just the spot, J,
Of finding out, though “ lying low‚” And so below he'd “ douse the glim‚'’— ἱ
How near New York their schooners ran. After, of course, his “something hot.'’
They greased the lead before it fell, Snug in his berth, at eight o’clock‚
And then by sounding, through the night, This ancient skipper might be found;
Knowing the soil that stuck so well, No matter how his craft would rock,
They always guessed their reekoning right. He slept,—f0r skipper's naps are sound·
