HENRY WARD BEECHER.
Pulpit Orator and Author.

 

 

Ι 'bis‘ :O public man has achieved greater distinction than this gifted ²
writer and pulpit orator, of whom it has been said “he was a .
''T'‘ < grand outgrowth of American institutions.’' He was a son of
’ Dr. Lyman Beecher, and was born in Litchfield‚ Conn.,on the y
4th of June, 1813. He appears to have given in childhood but a
little promise of distinction.

But even while a boy he proved that he inherited something of the ἶ
controversia] ability of his father. A forward schoolboy among the elder
scholars had got hold of Paine's “Age of Reason‚’' and was flourishing ,
largely among the boys with objections to the Bible. Henry privately
looked up Watson’s “ Apology,'’ studied up the subject, and challenged ’
a debate with the big boy, in which he came off victorious by the acela· -·

 

mation of his schoolfellows. This occurred when he was about eleven
years old.

He manifested at this period little inclination for severe study, but ἰ
had conceived a passionate desire to go to sea. His father adroitly used ’
this desire to induce him to commence a course of mathematics with a ,
view to qualify himself to become a naval officer. He applied himself
energetically to his new studies, ‘⁴ with his face to the navy, and Nelson γ .
as his beau ideal.’' But not long afterwards there occurred in that sec· ,-
tion of the country a religious “ revival,’' and young Beecher, with many f,
others, was powerfully impressed. The result was that the naval scheme ’
was abandoned, and his thoughts were directed to the pulpit as his 7 Δ
natural and proper sphere. · Δ ⁴

After going through the preparatory studies, he entered Amherst
College, where he graduated in 18343 and soon after he commenced the ,
study of theology at Lane Seminary, under the direction of his father.
He began his ministerial course at Lawrenceburg, Indiana, but removed ·,'
soon after to Indianapolis. In 1847 he became pastor of Plymouth 223.
