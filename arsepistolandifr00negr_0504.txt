THE WEAVER..
ΒΥ MARY CLARK HUNTINGTON.

ESIDE the loom of life I stand
Β And walch the busy shnttlc go3
The threads l holds within niy hand
Make np the filling; strand on strand
They slip my iingers through, and so
This wel) of minc filis out apncc
thile I stand ever in my place.

One tiine the woof is sniooth and fine
And colored with a snnn)v dye;

Again the threads so ronghly twine

And weave so darkly lino on line,

My heart inisgives me, Then would I
F ain lose this web———begin ancw—
But that, alas! I cannot do.

Some day the web will all be done,
The shuttle quiet in its place,
From out my hold the threads be run ;
And friends at setting of the sun,-
Will Come to look upon my face,
And say: “ Mistakes she made not few,
Yet wove perchance as best she knew.”

Lord Ross pursued these creations of God still
deeper into space, and, having resolved the
nebulze of the Milky XVay into stars, discov-

points, glittering through the black darkness

 

The following is a celebrated

-— when he saw these systems scattered pro-
susely throughout space—when he reflected
upon their immense distance, their enormous
magnitude, and the countless milliens of
worlds that belonged to them—it seemed to
him as though the wild dream of the German
poet was more than realized.

“ God called man in dreams into the vesti-
bule of heaven, saying, ‘ come up hither, and

I will show thee the glory of my house.’ And
