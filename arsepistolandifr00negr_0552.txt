ΤΟ A FAIR YOUNG FRIEND.

COULD I bring lost youth back again,

And be what I have been,
I'd court you in a gallant strain,
My young and fair Florine.

But mine’s the chilling age that chides
Devoted rapture's glow;

And love, that conquers all besides,

Finds time a conquering foe.

Farewell! we're severed by our fate

As far as night from noon;

You came into this world so late,

And Ι depart so soon!

LORD ULLIN'S DAUGHTER..

CHIEFTAIN, to the Highlands bound,

Cries‚ “ Boatman, do not tarry!
And I’ll give thee a silver pound
To row us o'er the ferry.''

“ Now who be ye, would cross Loehgyle,
This dark and stormy water? ”

“ O, I'm the chief of Ulva’s isle,
And this Lord Ullin's daughter.

“ And fast before her father's men

Three days we’ve fied together;

For should he find us in the glen,
My blood would stain the heather.

“His horsemen hard behind us ride;
should they our steps discover,
Then who will eheer my bonny bride
When they have slain her lover ἶ) ”-

Out spoke the hardy Highland wight,
“ I’ll go, my chief—I’m ready.

It is not for your silver bright,
But for your winsome lady.

“ And by my word! the bonny bird

In danger shall not tarry;
So, though the waves are raging white,
I’ll row you o'er the ferry.”

By this the storm grew loud apaoe;
The water-wraith was shrieking;
And in the scowl of heaven each face
Grew dark as they were speaking.

But still as wilder blew the wind,
And as the night grew dreamr,
Adown the glen rode armed men-

Their trampling sounded nearer.

“ Oh haste thee, haste! '' the lady criesg

“ Though tempests round us gather;
I’ll meet the raging of the skies,
But not an angry father.''

The boat has left a stormy land,
A stormy sea before her—

When‚ oh! too strong for human hand,
The tempest gathered o’er her.²
