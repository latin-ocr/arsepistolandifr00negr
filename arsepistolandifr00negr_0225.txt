Known as “Artemus Ward.''

    
  

μὴ 1 <51ss UMOR appears to be the birthright of some persons. It comes
J? ¹ a ‘ll as naturally as water flows from a spring. With others it is a
ff: ¹< ‘J 3} manufactured article and poor at the best. Manufactured
⁴ humor, concocted and emitted for the sake of appearing to be
humorous, must always be a failure. There is much of real
wit that never appears in print. It sparkles in the conversa-
tion of men and women, and sometimes unconsciously in that of even
children.

The present sketch concerns a natural born humorist. Charles
Farrar Browne did not have to put on the character he exhibited in his
writings. He had only to act out the natural character which was his
own. He was a native of Waterford‚ Maine, and was born in 1834. He
began life as a compositor and occasional contributor to the daily and
weekly journals. Starting out like so many New England boys to make
his fortune, he became connected with the “ Cleveland Plaindealer‚’' and
contributed to this journal a description of an imaginary travelling
menagerie under the style of ‘⁴ Artemus Ward‚ Showman.'' These arti-
cles attracted wide attention, and in 1860 he became editor of “Vanity
Fair‚'' a humorous New York weekly, which proved a failure in spite of
all his brilliant contributions.

About the same time he began to appear as a lecturer, and by his
droll and eccentric humor attracted large audiences. The title of one of
his lectures was ‘⁴ Babes in the Wood‚’' the pith of which was that he said
nothing about Babes in the Wood, but hit off many of the follies and insipid
customs of society, especially pompous bores who make a great flourish
of saying nothing. In 1866 he visited Engl'and where he became exceed-
.ingly popular as a lecturer and as a contributor to “Punch.’' In the
spring of the following year his health gave way and he died of con-
sumption at Southampton on March 6, 1867.

One of his works is entitled “ Artemus Ward among the Mormons.''
