ninety-six of whom were to be feasted in‘

the gardenS, and waited on by the Ladies-
Patronesses.

Well‚ Jemmy and my daughter, Madame
de Flicflac‚ myself, the Count, Baron Punter‚
Tug‚ and Tagrag, all went down in the ohariot
and barouche-and-four, quite eclipsing poor
Lady Kilblazes and her carriage—and-two.

There was a fine cold collation, to which
the friends of the Ladies-Patronesses were
admitted, after which, my ladies and their
beaux went strolling through the walks; Tag-
rag and the Count having each an arm of
Jemmy; the Baron giving an arm a-piece to
Madame and Jemimarann. Whi1st they were
walking, whom should they light upon but
poor Orlando Crump, my successor in the
perfumery and hair-cutting.

“ Orlando 1 '’ says Jemimarann,blushing as
red as a label, and holding out her hand.

“ Jemimar! ‘⁷ says he, holding out his, and
turning as white as pomatum.

“Sir l '’ says Jemmy as stately as a Duchess.

“ What! madam,‘’ says poor Crump, “ don't
you remember your shopboy ⁴? ”

“Dearest mamma, don't you recollect Or-
lando ⁶? '' whimpers Jemimarann, whose hand
he had got hold of.

“ Miss Tuggeridge-Coxe,” says Jemmy, “ I'm
surprised at you. Remember, sir, that our
position is altered, and oblige me by no more
familiarity.'’

“ Insolent fellow 1 ” says the Bau-on, “ vat is
dis canaille? '’

“ Canal yourself, Monseer,” says Orlando,
now grown quite furious; he broke away,
quite indignant, and was soon lost in the
crowd. Jemimarann, as soon as he was gone,
began to look very pale and ill; and her
mamma, therefore took her to a tent, where
she left her along with Madame Flicflac and
the Baron3 going off herself with the other gen-
tlemen, in order to join us.

It appears they had not been seated very
long, when Madame Flicflac suddenly sprang
up, with an exclamation of joy, and rushed
forward to a friend whom she saw pass

The Baron was left alone with Jemimarann ;
and whether it was the champagne, or that my
dear girl looked more than commonly pretty,

Ι don't know ς but Madame Flicflae had not
been gone a minute, when the Baron dropped
on his knees and made her a regular dec-
laration.

Poor Orlando Crump had found me out by
this time, and was standing by my side‚listen-
ing, as melancholy as possible, to the famous
Bohemian Minnesingers, who were singing
the celebrated words of the poet Gothy :

“ Ich bilnl yzlt hupp lily lee, du bist ya hupp
wir 8ἰῖιέ ‹iss’ch hupp my 1ee, hupp la lily
“ Chorus—eiffodle - odle - odle - odle - odle - odle

hupp ! yodle-odle-aw-o-o-o! ''

They were standing with their hands in their
waistcoats, as usual, and had just come to the
“ o—o-o,” at the end of the chorus of the forty-
seventh stanza, when Orlando started : ‘⁴ That’s
a scream 1 '' says he. “ Indeed it is‚'' says I ;
“ and, but for the fashion of the thing, a very
ugly scream too, '’ when Ι heard another
shrill “ Oh 1 ’' as I thought; and Orlando ¹
bolted off, crying, “By heavens, it's her voice 1⁰
“ Whose voice? ’' says I. “ Come and see the
row,” says Tag. And off we went, with a
considerable number of people, who saw this
strange move on his part.

We came to the tent, and there we found
my poor Jemimarann sainting3 her mamma
holding a smelling bot-tle ; the Baron on the
ground, holding a handkerchief to his bleed-
ing nose; and Orlando squaring at him, and
calling on him to fight if he dared.

My Jemmy looked at Crump very fierce.
“Take that feller away,” says she 3 “he has
insulted a F rench nobleman, and desei-ves
transportation, at the least.''

Poor Orlando was carried off. “I've no
patience with the little minx,'’ says Jemmy,
giving Jemimarann a pinch. “She might be
a Baron's lady3 and she screams out because
his Excellency did but squeeze her hand.'’

“⁶ Oh, mamma! mamma ! '' sobs poor Jemi-
marann, “ but he was t-t-tipsy.'’

“ T—t tipsyl and the more shame for you,
you hussy, to be offended with a nobleman who
does not know what he is doing.’'
