RALPH WALDO EMERSON. 51

THE SNOW-STORM.

NNOUNCED by all trumpets of the sky
Arrives the snow, and driving o'er the
fields,

Seems nowhere to alight: the whited air
Hides hills and woods, the river, and the heaven,
And veils the farm-house at the garden's end.
The sled and traveller stopped, the courier’s feet
Delayed, all friends shut out, the honsemaids sit
Around the radiant sire-place, enclosed

, In a tumultuous privacy of 5101111.

Come see the north wind’s masonry.
Out of an unseen quari-y cvermore
Furnished with tile, the ssei-ce artifices
Curves his white bastions with projeeted roof
Round every windward stake, or tree, or door.

 

Speeding, the myriad-handed, his wild work
So fanciful, so savage, nought cares 116

For number or proportion. Mockingly

On ooop or kennel he hangs Parian wreaths ;
A swan—like form invests the hidden thorn ;
Fill up the farmer‘s lane from wall to wall,
Maugre the farmer‘s siglis, and at the gate
A tapering turret overtops the work.

And when his hours are nurnbered, and the
world

Is all his own, retiring, as he were not,

Leaves‚ when the 51111 appears, astonished Art

To mimio in slow structures, stone by stone,

Built in an age, the mad wind's night-work,

The frolic arehiteet of the suow.

THE SPHINX.

Her wings are furled,
Her 63115 heavy,
She broods on the world.
‘⁸ Who'll tell me my secret
The ages have kept!
Ι awaited the seer
While they slumbered and slept,

“ The fate of the manehild-
The meaning of 111311-

Known fruit of the unknown,
Daedalian plan.

Out of sleeping a waking,
Out of waking a sleep,

Life death overtaking,
Deep underneath deep.

THE Sphinx is drowsy.

“ Ereot as a sunbeam

Upspringeth the palm;

The elephant browses
Undaunted and calm;

In beautiful motion
The thrush plies his* wings,

Kind leaves of his covert!
Your- silenee he sings.

“The waves unashamed
In difference sweet,
Play glad with the breezes,
Old playfellows meet.

 

The journeying atoms,
Primordial wholes,

Firmly draw, firmly drive.
By their animate poles.

“ Sea, earth, air, sound‚ silence,

Plant, quadruped, bird,

By 0116 11111510 enohanted‚
One deity stirred,

Eaeh the other adorning,
Aeconipany still,

Night veileth the morning,
The vapor the hill.

‘⁴ The habe, by its mother,

Lies bathed in joy,

Glide its 1101115 uneounted,
The sun is its t0y;

Shines the peace of all being
Without cloud in its eyes,

And the sun of the world
In soft minature 1165.

“ But man erouohes and blushes,
Absconds and conceals;
He ereepeth andipeepeth,
He palters and steals;
Infirm, melancholy,
Jealous glaneing around,
An oaf, 311 accomplice,
He poisons the ground.
