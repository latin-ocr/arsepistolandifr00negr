“ The Hoosier Author.’'

{WHIS Methodist clergyman, J ournalist and author of a number of
s . Hoosier 'stories that have been well received by the reading
r :› κρῖν’( . public, was born in Vevay, Indiana, in 1837. His father was
a Virginia lawyer and his mother a native of Kentucky. As
his health was delicate, he received his education mostly at
home and continued ill health has several times obliged him
to abandon the ministry.

He has been both a circuit rider and a settled pastor3 a farmer and
a storekeeper3 an editor and an author, and has lived in the Wes‘c and in
the East. He has written juvenile stories and contributed to mature
literature, both religious and secular. In 1870-71 he was editor of the
New York “ Independent’' and of “Hearth and Home,'' and from 1872
to 1879 was pastor of a Brooklyn church, “ a church without a creed.’'
In the latter year, however, ill health compelled him to retire to his home
on Lake George, from which have issued several of his most charming
stories. ’

Resides having established himself in American literature with the
“Hoosier Schoolmaster,'’ 1871, he is admired as the auther of “The
Graysons,'' the “The Circuit Rider‚’' 1874, and other stories, all of which
have a pure, healthy tone. He published “ End of the World ’' in 1872 3
“The Mystery of Metropolisville'’ in 18733 “The Circuit Rider'' in
1874, “School-master's Stories for Boys and Girls '' in 18743 “The
Hoosier School-boy'’ in 18833 and “The Beginners of a Nation '' in
1897. Mr.Egg1eston speaks of his own works as follows: “1 should
say that what distinguishes my novels from other works of fiction is the
prominence which they give to social conditions3 that the individua] char-
acters are here treated to 3 greater degree than elsewhere as parts of a
study os a society, as in some sense the logical result of the environment.
Whatever may be the rank assigned to these stories as works of literary
art, they will always have a certain value 35 materials for the student of

social history.''
