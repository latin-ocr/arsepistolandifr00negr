his· own place in literature, not by newspaper Praise, not by‘,
the endorsement of pretentious critics, but by the merit of his*
works. These are descriptive‚ pathetic, humorous, and contain
such delineations of character as we get from the pen of nov
other author. Chai-les Dickens was a phenomenon. Consid-
ering the great number of his stoi-ies, no one can help expressing surprise>
at their variety, their originality and sustained power. He vaulted into',
notoriety with ‘⁴ Pickwick Papers‚” and then for many years wielded his*
magic pen with increasing deftness and success.

The name of Gladstone, or Napoleon, or Lincoln, or McKinley, is
not better known than that of Pickwick, or Micawber‚ or Pecksniff‚ orl

The great novelist, whose works of fiction are known and read
throughout the civilized world, and who gained a renown unequaled by
that of any author of recent times, was born at Portsmouth, England,
February 7, 1812. His father wished him to enter the profession of law,
but soon becoming disgusted with it, because he was conscious that it was·

became a reporter for the “ Morning Chronicle.'' For this paper he began-
to write sketches that at once attracted attention and showed their author*
to be possessed of an uncommon faculty for depicting common life both‘
in its tragic and humorous phases. '

Dickens was only 24 years old when he published “ Pickwick

Papers.'' Hc immediately sprang into popularity, and became thes
506 .
