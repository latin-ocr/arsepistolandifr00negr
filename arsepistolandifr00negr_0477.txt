A farmer came from the village plain——
But he lost the traveled way ;

And for 110013 116 trod with might aud main
A path for his 110136 aud sleigh ;

But colder still the cold 11111113 111611,

And deeper still the deep drifts grew,

And his mare, a beautiful Morgan brown,

At last in her struggles fiouudered down,
Where a log 111 a hollow lay.

In vain with a neigh aud a srenzied snort,
She plunged in the driftinyg 311011,
While 1161 1063161 urged, till his breath grew
short,
With a word and a gentle hlow ;
But the snow was deep, and the tugs were
tight;
His hands werc 011101), and had lost their
might;
So he wallowed back to his half-filled sleigh,
And strove to shelter himself till day,
With 1113 6061 and the buffalo.

He has given the last faint jerk of the rein,
To ronse up his dying steed ;

And the poor dog howls to 1116 1116313111 vain,
For help in his 1063161’3 06611.

For a while 116 3111163 with a wistful cry
To catch a glauce from 1113 (110113)7 eye,
And wags 1113 tail if the rude 11111113 1161)
The skirt of 1116 buffalo over 1113 lap,
And whines when he takes 110 116611.

The wind goes down and the storm 13 o’er—
’Tis 1116 hour of niidnight, past ;
The old 11663 11111116 and bend 110 10016
In 1116 1111111 of 1116 rushing blast.
The silent moon 111111 1161 peaceful light
Looks down on the 111113 with snow all white,
And the giant shadow of Camel’s Hump,
The blasted pine aud ghostly stump,
Afar 011 1116 plain are cast.

But cold and dead by the hidden log
Are they who came from the town—
The man in his sleigh, and his· faithful dog,
And his beautiful Morgan brown—
In the wide show-desert, far and grand,
With his cap 011 1113 head and the 16103 111 1113
hand—-
The dog with his 11036 011 1113 master’s feet,
And the mare half seen through the crusted
31661,
11711616 3116 lay when 3116 floundered down.

THE DRUNKARD’S DREAM.
ΒΥ GHARLES w. DENISON.

HE drunkard dreamed of his old retreat,
Of 1113 cosy place in the tap—room seat;
And the liquor gleamed on his gloating
eye,
Till his lips 10 1116 sparkling glass drew nigh.
He lifted it up with 611 eager glauce,
And sang 63 116 saw the bubbles dance:
“ Ah! I am 10173611ἱ again!
Here's a 111166 10 6616, and adieu to pain.
Weleome the cup with 113 creamy 106111-
Farewell 10 work and a 1001))Γ 1101116--
With ajolly crew and a flowing 110111,
In bar-room pleasures I love 10 10111 ”

*Like a crash there came 10 1116 drunkard's side
His angel child, 11110 that night had died ;
With a look 30 gentle and sweet aud fond,
She touched his glass with her little 1161111 ;

 

And oft as he raised it up 10 drink,

She silently tapped on its trembling brink,
Till the drunkard shook froin foot to crown,
And set the untasted goblet down. [this?
“ Hey‚ man 1’' cried the host, “ what meaneth
Is the covey sick? or the drani amissi?

Cheer up, my lad—quick,the bumper quaff! '’
And he glared around with a fiendish laugh.

The drunkard raised 1113 glass once more,

And looked at 113 depths as so oft before;

But started to 366 00 113 pictured foam,

The face of his dead little child at home;

Then again the landlord at him sneered,

And the swaggering crowd of 111-0111011113
jeered ;

Β111 still, 63 116 tried that glass 10 drink,

The waud of his dead one tapped the brink!
