κ ’ ’ ORN in Medford, Mass, February 11, 1802, Lydia Maria Francis
‘ came of a good family who prized education. She was the
'⁵' L, pupil of an eccentric but talented woman, and was also
³ instructed by her brother, who was afterward Professor of

Theology at Harvard College.
She began her literary life with “ Hobomok, a Tale of

the Pilgrim times, and the scene is chiefly in Salem and Plymouth.

This book was followed, in the next year, by ‘⁶ The Rebels, a Tale of
the Revolution.'’ It is worth mentionfflg, that the speech of James Otis,
in this novel, which is often quoted in school books, and has found its
way into histories, as authentic, as well as Whitefield’s celebrated sermon,
in the same work, was coined entirely by Mrs. Child. K

“The Mother’s Book,'’ and the ‘⁴ Girl’s Book,'' appeared soon after
and were designed to teach the true relations existing between mothers
and their daughters. Her mind was turned toward the enlightenment

and moral improvement of her own sex, and she wrote “ Lives of Madame
