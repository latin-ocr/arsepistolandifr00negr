FAVORITE POEMS AND PROSE SELECTIONS.

‘⁴ Ι know not if the Christian's heaven
shall be the same as mine ;

I only ask to be forgiven,
And taken home to Thine.

I weary on a far, dim strand,
Whose mansions are as tombs,
And long to find the Fatherland,

· Where there are many homes.

Oh, grant, of all yon starry thrones,
Some dim and distant star,

Where J udah's lost and scattered sons
May love Thee from afar.

Where all earth's myriad harps shall meet
In choral praise and prayer,

shall Zion's harp, of old so sweet,
Alone be wanting there ⁶?

Yet place me in Thy lowest seat,
Though Ι, as now, be there,

The Christian's scorn, the Christian’s jest3
But let me see and hear,

From some dim mansion in the sky,

Thy bright ones and their melody.’'

The sun goes down with sudden gleam,
And—beautiful as a lovely dream
And silently as air—-
The vision of a dark-eyed girl,
With long and raven hair,
Glides in—as guardIan spirits glide—
And 101 15 kneeling by his side,
As if her sudden presence there
Were sent in answer to his prayer.

(Oh, say they not that angels tread
Around the good man's dying bed ?)
His child—his sweet and sinless child——
And as he gazed on her
He knew his God was reconciled,
And this the messenger‚
As sure as God had hung on high
The promise bow before his eye—
Earth's purest hopes thus o'er him flung,
To point 1115 heavenward saith,
And life’s most holy feeling strung
To sing him into death;
And on his daughter’s stainless breast
The dying Hebrew found his rest!

WASHINGTON’S ADDRE'SS TO HIS TROOPS.
BEFORE „THE BATTLE oF LONG ISLAND.

Born 1732 ;

HE time is now near at hand, which must
probably determine whether Americans
are to be freemen or slaves; whether

they are to have any property they can call
their own; whether their houses and farms
are to be pillaged and destroyed, and them-
selves consigned to a state of wretchedness,
from which no human efforts will (10111701-

The fate of unborn millions will now de-
pend, under G0d‚ on the courage and con—
duct of this army. Our cruel and unrelent-
ing enemy leaves us only the choice of a
brave resistance, or the most abject submis-
sion. We have, therefore, to resolve to con-
quer or to die.

Our own, our country’s honor, calls upon us
for a vigorous and manly exertion3 and if we
now shamefully fail, we shall become infamous
to the whole world. Let 115, then, rely on

Supreme Being, in whose hands victory is, to

now upon us, and we shall have their blessings

Liberty, property, life, and honor are all at

success so just a cause.
