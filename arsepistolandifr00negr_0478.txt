The landlord gasped, “ I swear, my man, But he saw, as he shooknwith pale, cold sear, ·
Thou shalt take every drop of this flowing , Α beautiful angel hoverlng near. . .

The ‹lrunkard howed to the quivering brim, It checked his pasfflons, lt swayed his will,
Thmurh his heart beat fast and his eyes grew It dashed from 1115 hps the maddemng bowl,
Ο dim. And victory gave to 1115 ransomed soul.

 

 

But the wand struck hai-der than before: Since ever that midnight hour he dreamed,
The glass 11115 flung on the bar-room floor. Onr hero has been a man redeemed,
All around the ring the fragments lay, And this 15 the prayer that he prays alway,
And the poisonous current rolled away. And this is the prayer let us help him pray:
Tho d rnnkard woke. His ‹li-eam was gone ; T hat angels may come 111 every land,
His hed was bathed in the light of niorn ; To dash the cup from the drunkard's hand.

Hark to an exiled son's appeal,
Maryland!

My 111011161- State to thee I kneel,

For life or death, for woe or weal,

Thy peerless chivalry reveni,

And gird thy beauteous 11111115 with steel,
Marylami. my Maryland !

She meets her sisters on the plain,

“ Sic semper Ι ” ’tis the proud refrain

T hat baffles minions back amaia,
Maryland !

Arise in majesty again,

Maryland, my Marylandl

Come! for thy shield is bright and strong,
Maryland !

Thou wilt not cower in the d nst, Comei. for thy dallianee does thee wrong,

Mal-yland ! Maryland 1

Thy beaniing sword shall never rust, Come to thine own heroic throng

Maryland 1 Stalking with liberty along,

Rememher Uarroll’s sacred trust, And chant thy dauntless slogan-song, ’

And all thy slumherers with the just,

Maryland' my Maryland 1 I see the blush upon thy cheek,

Maryland 1
But thou wast ever bravely meek,
Maryland 1
But 10 1 there surges forth a shriek,
From hill to hill, from creek to creek,

Corne! 'tis the red dawn of the day,
Maryland !

Come with thy panoplied ari-ay,
Maryland !
