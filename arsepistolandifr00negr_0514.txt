there faetion seldom gathers head ;
But, by degrees to fullness wronght,
The strength ‹›f some ‹lill'usive thought

Hath time and space to work and spread.

Should banded uniens persecute
Opinion, and induce a tinie
then single thought is civil crime,
And individual freedom niute;

ALFRED TENNYSON.

Though power should make, from land to land,

The name of Britain trebly great-
Though every channel of the state

Should almost ohoke with golden sand—

Yet wast from me the harbor-mouth‚

Wild wind ! I seek a warmer sky,
And Ι will see, before I die,

The palms and temples of the South.

LOCKSLEY HALL.

OMRADES, leave me here a little, while
C as yet 'tis early 1110111-
Leave me here, and when you want
me, sound upon the bugle horn.

 

’Tis the place, and all around it, as of old, the
curlews call,
Dreary gleanis about the moorland, flying over

Loeksley Hall :

 

Locksley Hau, that in the distance overlooks
the sandy tracts,

And the hollow ocean-ridges roaring into
cataracta

Ι went to rest
Did Ι look on great Orion sloping slowly to
the west.

Many a night Ι saw the Pleiads, rising through
the mellow shade‚

Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a
silvei· braid.

Here about the beaoh I wandered, nourishing
a youth sublime

With the fairy tales of seience, and the long
result of tinie;

then the centuries behind me like a fruitful
land reposed .

When I clun g to all the present for the promise
that it closed ;

When Ι dipt into the future far as human eye
could see—
Saw the vision ofthe world, and all the wonder

Many a night from yonder ivied oasement, e're
that would be.

In the spring a fuller crimson oomoe upon the
robin's breast ;

In the spring the wanton lapwing gets himself
another orest ;

In the spring a livelier iris changes on the
burnished dove ;

In the spring a young man's fancy lightly turns
to thoughts of love.

Then her eheek was pale and thinner than
should be for one so young,

And her eyes 011 all my motions with a mute
observanee hung.

And I said, “My cousin Amy, speak, and
speak the truth to me;

Trust me, cousin, all the current of my being ’.

sets to thee.''

On her pallid eheek and forehead came a color
and a light,

As I have seen the rosy red flushing in the
northern night. ’

And she turned—her bosom shaken with a
sudden storm of sighs 3

All the spirit deeply dawning in the dark of
hazel eyes—

Saying, ⁴‘ Ι have hid my feelings, fearing they
should do me wrong;'’

Saying‚ ‘⁵ Dost thou love me, cousin ? ’' weep-
ing, “ I have loved thee loug.'’

Love took up the glass of time, and turned it
in his glowing hands:

Every moment, lightly shaken‚ ran itself in
golden sands.
