CHARLES KINGSLEY.

“A laborer in Christian England‚
Where they eant ofa Saviour’s name,

And yet waste men's lives, like the vermin’s,
For a few more brace of game.

“There’s hlood on your new foreign shrubs,
Therzzuhllhod on your pointer’s feet ;

There's blood on the game you sell, squire,
And there's blood on the game you eat.

“You have sold the laboring man, squire‚
Both body and soul to shame‚

To pay for your seat in the House, squire,
And to pay for the feed of your game.

“ You made him a poaeher yourself, squire,
When you’d give neither work nor meat,
And your barley-fed hares robbed the garden

At our starving children's feet.

“ When, paoked in one reeking chamber,
Man, maid, mother and little ones lay ;

While the rain pattered in on the rotten bride—
And the walls let in the day. [be‹l,

“When we lay in the burning fever,
On the mud of the eold clay floor,

Till you parted us all for three months, squire,
At the oursed workhouse door.

“ We quarrelled like brutes, and who wonders ’Β
What sels-respect eould we keep,
Worse housed than your hacks and your
pointers,
Worse fed than your hogs and your sheep

‘⁵ Our daughters, with base-born babieS,
Have wandered away in their shame ;

If your misses had slept, squire, where they did,
Your misses might do the same.

‘⁴ Can your lady pateh hearts that are breaking,
With handfuls of eoals and rice,

Or by dealing out flannel and sheeting
A little below eost price?

“ You may tire of the jail and the workhouse‚
And take to allotments and schools‚

But you’ve run up a debt that will never
Be repaid us by penny-club rules.

“ In the season of shame and sadness,
In the dark and dreary day,

When scrofula, gout, and madness
Are eating your race away;

“ When to kennels and liveried varlets
You have cast your daughters’ bread,

And, worn out with liquor and harlots,
Your heir at your feet lies dead ;

‘· then your youngest, the mealy·mouthed
Lets 1Jdiissrsoul rot asleep to theggran

You will find in your God the protector
Of the freeman you fancied your slave.’'

She looked at the tuft of clover,
And wept till her beart grew light ;
And at last, when her passion was over,

Over the upland still,

XVhere the clover and corn lay sleeping
On the side of the white chalk hill.

Out into the west as the sun went down ;

And trimmed the lamps as the sun went

Each thought of the woman who loved him And they looked at the squall, and they looked

For men must work, and women must weep ;
And there's little to earn, and many to keep,
Though the harbor bar be meaning.

And the raok it came rolling up, ragged
and brown;
But men must work, and women must weep,

Though storms be sudden, and waters deep,

And the harbor bar be moaning.
