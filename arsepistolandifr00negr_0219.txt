OVE'R THE RIVER.

VEB. the river they beckon to me,
Loved ones who have crossed to the
farther side,
⁷ The gleam of their snowy robes I see,
But their voices are lost in the dashing tide.
There's one with ringlets of sunny gold,
And eyes the reflection of heaven's own 111116 ;
Η6 crossed in the twilight gray and cold,
And the pale mist hid him from mortal view.
We saw not the angels who met him there,
The gates of the city we could not see:
Over the river, over the river,
My brother stands waiting to welcome me.

Over 1116 river the boatman pale
Garried another, the household pet3
Her brown curls waved in the gentle gale,
Darling Minnie! I see her yet.
She crossed on her bosom her dimpled hands,
And fearlessly entered the phantom bark ;
We felt it glide from the silver sands,
And all our sunshine grew strangely dark ;
> We know she is safe on the farther side,
Where all the ransomed and angels be:
Over the river, the mystic river,
My childhood's idol is waiting for me.

 

For none return from those quiet shores,
Who cross with the boatman cold and pale3
We hear the di p of the golden oars,
And catch 6 gleam of the snowy sail:
And lo ! they have passed from our yearning
hearts,
They cross 1116 stream and are gone for aye.
We may not sunder the veil apart
That hides from our vision the gates of day ;
We only know that their barks no more
May sail with us o'er life's stormy sea;
Yet, somewhere, Ι know, on the unseen shore,
They watch, and beckon, and wait for me.

And Ι 611 and think, when the sunset's gold
Is flushing river and hill and shore,
Ι shall one day stand by the water cold,
And list for the sound of the boatman’s 061·;
Ι 611611 watch for a glearn of the flapping 6611.
Ι shall hear the boat 66 11 gains the strand.
Ι 611611 pass from sight with the boatman pale,
To the better shore of the spirit land.
Ι 611611 know the loved who have gone before,
And joyfully sweet will the meeting be,
When over the river, the peaceful river,
The angel of death shall carry me.
