RALPH WALDO

“ Outspoke the great mother
Beholding his sear ;-
At the sound of her accents
Cold shuddered the sphere;—

Who has drugged my boy's cup,
tho has mixed my hoy's bread‘?

Who with sudness and madness,
Has turned the lnanchild's head ἶ ”

Ι heard a poet answer,

Alond and cheerfully‚
“Say on, sweet Sphinx l—thy dirges

Are plea<ant songs to me.

Deep love lieth under
These pictures of time,

They fade in the light of
Their meaning sublime,

“The flend that man harries,
Is love of the Best,
Yawns the Pit of the Dragon
Lit by rays from the Blest;
The Lethe of Nature
Can’t trance him again,
&Vhose soul sees the Perfect
Which his eyes seek in vain.

“ Profonnder, profounder

Man's spirit must dive:

To his aye-rolling orbit
No goal will arrive.

The heavens that now draw him
With sweetness nntold,

Once found—for new heavens
He spurneth the old.

“ Pride rnined the angels,
Their shame them restores.

And the joy that is sweetest
Lu rks in sti ngs of remorse.
Have I a lover
Who is noble and free—

EMERSON.

I would he were nobler
Than to love me.

“ Eterne alternation
Now follows, now flies‚
And under pain, pleasure*
Under pleasure, pain lies.
Love works at the centre
Heart heaving always,
Forth speed the strong pulses
To the borders of day.

‘⁴ Dull Sphinx, Jove keep thy five wits!

Thy sight is growing blear ;

Hemlock and vitrol for the Sphinx
Her muddy eyes to clear.'’

The old Sphinx bit her thick lip—
Said ‘¹ Who taught thee me to name?

Manchild! 1 am thy spirit;
Of thine eye I am eyebeam.

“ Thou art the unanswered question :—
Couldst see thy proper eye,
Alway it asketh, asketh,
And each answer is a lie.
So take thy quest through nature,
It through thousand natures ply,
Ask on, thou clothed eternity,
Time is the false reply.’'

Uprose the merry Sphinx,

And crouched no more in stone,

She hopped into the baby’s eyes,
She hopped into the moon,

She spired into a yellow fiame,
She flowered in blossoms red,

She flowered into a foaming wave‚
She stood Monadnoc's head.

Through a thousand voices
Spoke the universal dame,
“ Who telleth one of my meanings
Is master of all LamJ'

ΤΟ EVA.

H, fair and stater maid, whose eyes
&Vere kindled in the upper skies

At the same torch that lighted mine3

For so I must interpret still
Thy sweet dominion o'er my will,
A sympathy divine.

Ah. let me blameless gaze upon
Features that seem at heart my own ;
Nor fear those watchful sentinels,
Who charm the more their glance forbids,
Chaste-glowing, underneath their lidS,
With fire that draws while it repels,
