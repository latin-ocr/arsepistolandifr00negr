LYDIA HUNTLEY SIGOURNEY.

Spring’s- a maid of mirth and glee,
Rosy wreaths and revelry;

Hast thou woed some winged love
To a nest in verdant grove?

Sung to her of greenwood bower,
Sunny skies that never lower?
Lured her with thy promise fair
Of a lot that knows no care?
Pr’ythee, bird, in coat of blue‚
Thou a lover, tell her true.

Ask her if, when storms are long,
She 6611 sing a cheerful song?
When the rude winds rock the tree,
If she'll closer cling to thee?

Then the blasts that sweep the sky,
Unappalled shall pass thee by ;
Though thy curtained chamber show
Siftings of untimely 5110117,

Warm and glad thy heart shall be;
Love shall make it spring for thee.

A BUTTERFLY ΟΝ A GHILD’S GRAVE.
BUTTERFLY basked on ababy's grave, Then it lightly soared through the sunny air,

Where a lily had chanced to grow:
“Why art thou here, with thy gaudy
Wheni{{e of the blue and sparkling eye
Must sleep 111 the churchyard low ⁶? ’'

And spoke from its shining track:
“ I was a worm till I won my wings,
And she whom thou mournest, like a seraph
sincrs
Ψο111ᾶ5ῗ 111011 6611 1116 111651 0116 back? ”

NIAGARA.

LOW on forever, in thy glorious robe

Do venture boldly near, bathing their wing

Of terror and ‹rf beant-y, Yes, fiow cn, Amid thy foain and mist.—-'Tis meet for them

Unfathomed and 1651511655. Cro-l hath set
His rainbow on thy forehead, and the cloud
Mantled around thy seen—And he doth give
Thy voice of thunder power 10 speak of hini
Eternally—bidcling the lip of man
Keep silence, and upon the rocky altar pour
Incense of anve-struck praise.

The morning stars,

When first they sang o'er young creation's

birth, [fires
Hc-ard thy deep anthem—and those wrecking
'l‘lmt wait the archangel’s signal 10 dissolve
The 501111 earth, shall find Jehovah's 1161116
Graven, 65 with a thousand diainond spears,
On thine unfathomed page.——Each leafy bough
That lifts itself within thy prond domain,
Doth gather greenness from thy living spray,
And tremble at the baptism—Lo! yon birds

To 1011611 thy garment's hem—or lightly 5111·
The snowy leaflets of thy vapor 11166111-
Who sport unbarmed upon the fleecy cloud,
And 1151611 61 1116 echoing gate of heaven,
Without rep1·‹‘›of.—-But as for us—it seems
Scarce lawi'ul with our broken tones to speak
Fainiliar of thee‚—— Metliinks, 10 11111

Thy glorious features with 0111· pencil’s point,
Or woo thee to a tahlet of a song,

XVere profanation.

Thou dost make the 50111
Α wondering witness of thy majosty ;
And while it rushes with (1611110115 joy
To tread the vestibule, dost chain 115 step
And check its rapture 1111111116111111111111161716117
Of its own nothing-hess, bidding it stand
In the dread presence of the Invisible,
As if to answer 10 115 God through thee.
