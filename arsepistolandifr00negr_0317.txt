QUOTATIONS FROM MR. FIELD'S POEMS.

HAT night, while ›lengthening shadows I am sitting alone by the old hearth-stone
T crept, lVatohing the old year out,

I saw the white-winged angels come But Ι welcome the voice in yonder gloom,
With siuging to our lowly home, That solemnly calls to me;
And kiss my darling as 110 slept. “ Ἠώς-10011, tick-tock! ''—for so the cloek
—Christmcts Trea-sures ΤΘΗ-δ’ Ofa life to be;
“ Tiok-tock‚ tick-tock ! ’' 'tis so the cloek
PON a mountain height, far from the sea, Tells of eternity.
U Ῑ fOUnd 'd shell ; —Watehiny the New Year In.

HE gingham dog and the calloo eat The gingham dog went “ bow-wow-wow! ”
Side by side on the table sat; And the calico cat replied ‘⁴ me-ow ? ''
'Twas half-past twelve, and what do you And the air was streaked for an hour or so
think, With fragments of gingham and calico.
Neither of them had slept a wink! While the old Dutch clook in the chimney·
And the old Dutch clook and the Chinese place
plate Up with its hands before its face,
Seemed to know, as sure as fate, For it always dreaded a family row 1

There was going to be an awful spat.
