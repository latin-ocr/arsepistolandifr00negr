HARRIET BEECHER STOWE.

One year,--one year, one little year,
And so much gone!

And yet the even flow of life
Moves calmly on.

What visions fair, what glorious life,
there thou hast been?

The veil! the veill so thin, 60 strong
’Twixt us and thee;

The grave grows green, the flowers bloom fair The mystic veil‚ when shall it fall,

Above that head ;

No sorrowing tint of leaf or spray
Says he is dead.

No pause or hush of merry birds
That sing above,

Tell 116 how coldly sleeps below
The form we love.

VVhere hast thou been this year, beloved?
What hast thou seen,—

That we may see?

Not dead, not sleeping, not even gone,
But present still,

And waiting for the coming 110111
Of God's sweet will.

Lord of the living and 1116 dead,
0111· Saviour dear 1

We lay in silence at thy feet
This sad, sad year.

LINES ΤΟ ΤΗΕ MEMORY OF' “ANNIE.”
WHo DIED AT MILAN, JUNE 6, 1860.

N the fair gardens of celestial peace
Walketh a gardener in meekness clad ;
Fair are the flowers that wreathed his
dewy looks,
And his mysterious eyes are sweet and sad.

Fair are the silent foldings of his robes,
Falling with saintly calmness to his feet;
And when he walks, each floweret to his will

With living pulse of sweet accord doth beat.

Every green leaf thrills to its tender 116611,
In the mild summer radiance of his eye ;

No sear of storm, 01 cold, or bitter frost,
Shadows the flowerets when their sun is nigh-

And all our pleasant haunts of earthly love
Are nurseries 10 111066 gardens of the air ;

And his far-darting eye, with starry beam,
Watchin g the growing of his 1166611166 there.

We 6611 them 01116, o'erwept with selfish tears,
O'erwatched with 16611666 longings night and
13¹orgetfuldg>²gr t'he high, mysterious right
He holds to bear our cherished plante away.

But when some sunny spot in those bright fields
Needs the fair presence of an added flower,
Down sweeps a starry angel in the night:
At morn 1116 1066 1166 vanished from 0111
bower.

there stood our 1166, 0111 flower, there is 6
grave!
Blank, silent, vacant ; but in worlds above,
Like a new star outblossomed 111 1116 611166,
The angele hail an added flower of love.

Dear friend, no more upon 11161101161)1 mmmd,
Strewed with the red and yellow autumn leaf,

Drop thou the tear, but raise the fainting eye
Beyond the autumn 1111616 of earthly grief.

Thy garden rosebud bore within its breast
Those mysteries of 60101, warm and bright,

That the bleak climate of this lower sphere
Could never waken into form and light.

Yes, the sweet Gardener hath borne her hence,
Nor must thou ask 10 take her thence away ;
Thou shalt behold her, 111 some coming honr,

Full blossomed iu his fields of cloudless day,
