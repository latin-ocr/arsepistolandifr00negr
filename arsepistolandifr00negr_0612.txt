Who now hath quite forgot to rave,
While birds of calm sit brooding on the

charmed wave.

The stam, with deep amaze,
Stand fixed in steadfast gaze,

Bending one way their precious influeuce;
And will not take their flight,

For all the morning light,
Or Lucifer, that often warned them thence;

But in their gliinniering orbs (lid glow‚
Until their Lord himself bespake, and bid

them go,

The shepherds on the lawn,
Or e’er the point of dawn,
Sat simply chatting in a rustic row;
Full little thought they, than
That the mighty Pan
&Vas kindly come to live with them below ;
Perhaps their loves, or else their sheep,
Was all that did their silly thoughts so busy
keep.

then· such music sweet
Their hearts and ears did greet,

As never was by mortal finger strook ;
Divinely-warbled voice
Answering the stringed noise,

As all their souls in blissful rapture too k3
The air such pleasures louthe to lose,
With thousand echoes still prolongs each hea-

venly close.

The orat-les are dunib,
No voice or hideous hum
Runs through the arched roof in words
deceiving.
Apollo from his shrine
Can no more divine,

JoHN MILTON.

Witii hollow shriek the steep of Delphos
eavmg

No mighty tmnce, or breathed spell,
Inspires the pale-eyed priest from the pro-
phetie cell.

The lonely mountains o’er
And the resounding shore,

A voice of weeping heard and loud lament;
From haunted spring and dulc,
Edged with poplar pale,

The parting Genius is with sighing sent:
With flower-inwoven tresses torn,
The Nymphs‚ in twilight shade of tangled

thickets, mourn.

In consecrated earth,
And on the holy hearth,
The Lars and Lcmu rs moan with midnight
plaint.
In urns and altars round,
A drear and dying sound,
Affrights the Flamens at their service
quaint;
And the ehilled marble seems to sweat,
While ench peculiar Power foregoes his ¹
wonted seat.

But see, the Virgin blessed
Hath laid her Babe to rest;
Time is, our tedicus song should here have ’
ending:
Heaven’s youngest-teemed star
Hath fixed her polished car,
Her sleeping Lord with handmaid lamp
attending,
And all about the courtly stable

Bright-harnessed angels sit in order service,
able.
