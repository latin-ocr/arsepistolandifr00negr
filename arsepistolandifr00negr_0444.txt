get wetted a bit when it rained. An' Noah
took lots of things to eat in the ark—
cookies, an' milk, an' oatmeal, an’ strawber-
ries, an’ porgies, an'—oh, yes, plumpuddings,
an’ pumpkin-pie.

‘· But Noah ‹lidn’t want everybody to get
‹lrowned, so he talked to folks an' said, ‘ It's
goin'to rain awfctl pretty 50011; you'd better
be good, an’ then the Lord’ll let you come
into my a1·k.' An' they jus’ said, ‘Ohl if it
rains we'll go in the house till it stops3' an'
other folks said, ‘ We ain't afraid of rain·
we've got an mubrella! Au' some more said
they wasn't goin' to be afraid of just a rain.
But it did rain though, an' folks went in their
houses, an' the water came 111, an’ they went
up stairs, an' the water came up the1e‚ an'
they got on the tops of the houses‚ an’ up in
big trees, an' up in mount-ains, an’ the water
went after 'em everywhere an' drownded
evcrybody, only just except Noah an’ the
people in the ark.

“An it rained forty days an' nights‚ an’
then it stopped, an' Noah got out of the ark,
an' he an' his little boys an' little girls went
wherever they wanted to, an' everything in
the world was all theirs; there wasn't any-

‘⁸ Miss Mayton herewith returns to Mr. Burton the package
which just arrived, with his card. She recognizes the con-
tents as a portion of the apparent property of one of Mr-
Burton's nephews, but is unable to understand why it should
have been sent to her.

“ Toddie,'' I roared, as my younger nephew
oaressed his loathsome doll, and murmured
endearing words to it, “where did you get
that box? ''

“ On the hat-wack‚'' replied the youth, with
perfect fearlessness. “I keeps it in ze book-

about the stove in their quarters and smoked

their evening pipes. One evening the old
man remarked:

“When I was in New York, I heard the

was named for one of his mules, and had a
deft finger for the banjo.

“Go?'' echoed Old Brayley, with a short

introspective.

“VVell, if you'd heerd a tune a full hour
