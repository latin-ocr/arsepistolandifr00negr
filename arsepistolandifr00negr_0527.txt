ROBERT BURNS. 479

ἶ Maybe Thou lets this fleshly thorn Wi' great an' sma’‚
, Beset Thy servant e'en and morn, Frae God’s ain priests the people’s hearts
ἓ Lest he owre high and proud should turn, He steals awa'.
¹ 'Cause he's sae gifted ;
If gae, Thy hand‘maun e’en be borne, An' when we chastened him therefore,
Until Thou list, it, Thou kens how he bred sic a splore,
As set the warld in a roar
Lord, bless thy chosen in this place, O’ laughin’ at us :—
For here Thou hast chosen a race; Curse Thou his basket and his stone,
But God confound their stubborn face, Kail and potatoes.
And blast their name,
Wha bring Thy elders to disgraee, But Lord, remember me and mine
An’ public shame. Wi' mercies temp'ral and divine,
That Ι for gear and grace may shine,
Lord, mind Gawn Hamilton’s deserts, Excelled by nane,
He drinks, an' swears, an' plays at cartes, An' a' the glory shall be Thine,
Yet has sae monie takin' arts‚ Amen, Amen.

 

HIGHLAND MARY.

E banks and braes, and streams around Wi’ monie a vow, and loeked embrace,
Y The castle o' Montgomery, Our parting was full and tender;
Green be your woods, and fail-your fiowers, And pledging aft to meet again,
Your waters never drumliel We tore ourselves asunder ;
There simmer first unfaulds her robes, But, oh! fell death’s untimely frost,
And there she langest tarries! That nipt my fiower so early!
For there I took the last fareweel Now green's the sod. and eauld’s the clay
O’ my sweet Highland Mary. That wraps my Highland Mary!
How sweetly bloomed the gay green birk, O pale, pale now those rosy lips
How rich the hawthorn’s blossom I aft ha’e kissed sae fondly!
As underneath their fragrant shade, And closed for aye the sparkling glauce
Ι elasped her to my bosom 1 That dwelt on me sae kindly;
The golden hours, on angel wiugs, And mouldering now in silent dust,
Flew o'er me and my dearie3 That heart that loved me dearly ;
For dear to me as light aud life But still within my bosom’s core

Was my sweet Highland Mary. Shall live my Highland Mary.
