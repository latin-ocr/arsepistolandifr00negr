JOHN ΗΑΥ.
Author and Secretary of State.

 

        

    

HAT a man who began his public life by writing one or two
somewhat humorous poems, which served to bring him into
notice, should enter the field of politics and advance step by
step until he held the first position in the Cabinets of two ν
Presidents, evinces talent of no ordinary kind. Between a
humorous poet and a statesman there does not seem to be any Ι

affinity, or any relation except such as would appear grotesque. Yet

Mr. Hay achieved a fair success in his early life as an author, and after-

Mr. Hay was born at Salem, Ind., October 8, 1838, and was sent to
Providence, R. L, to be educated and graduated at Brown's University.
He studied law and began practice at Springfield, HL, where he became -
acquainted with Abraham Lincoln, and was afterward made Mr. Lincoln's
private secretary. He also acted as Lincoln's adjutant, was major and
assistant adj utant-general under Generals Hunter and Gilmore and was
breveted colonel.

By this time he seemed to be marked for official station and was
appointed United States Secretary of Legation at Paris, Having served
in this capacity two years, he was made Secretary of Legation at Madrid.
He returned to this country in 1870 and became prominently connected
with the “ New York Tribune.'' For a considerable time this journal was
under Mr. Hay's active management. Subsequently he made Cleveland,
Ohio, his place of residence, and later was first assistant Secretary of
State under President Hayes.

Soon after Mr. McKinley was elected President he appointed Mr.
Hay our ambassador to Great Britain, where he acquitted himself with
credit to himself and his country. When william R. Day resigned as Sec-
retary of State from Mr. McKinley's cabinet, Mr. Hay was appointed to
that position and his subsequent career showed the wisdom of the choice.

In 1871 Mr. Hay issued a volume of poems called “ Pike County .

Ballads,’' in which two poems that were already famous are included and
