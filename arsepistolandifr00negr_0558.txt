fined to a yacht or a yew-trec; and Z, con-
demned forever to he a zebra or a zany.

becomes a bean-stalk‚——the marvelous bean-
stalk by which J ack climbed up to the giant's
house. Jack‚—how noble, with his sword of
sharpness and his shoes of swiftness!

Good for Ch 1-1311003-111110 is the ruddy color
of the cloak in which, the tree making a forest
of itself for her to trip through with her
basket, Little Red Riding-Hood comes to me
one Christmas eve, to give me information of
the cruelty and treachery of that dissembling
wolf who ate her grandmothcr‚ without mak-
ing any impression on his appetite, and then

ate her, after making that ferocious joke about Α

1113 100111. She was my first love. I felt that ifI
could have married Little Rcd Riding-Hood
I should have known perfect bliss. But it
was not to be, and there was nothing for it
but to look out the wolf in the Noah's Ark
there, and put him late in the procession on

not found seaworthy when put in a washing-
tub, and the animals were crammed in at the
roof, and needed to have their legs well shaken

fastened with a wire latch ; but what was that
against it?

Consider the noble fiy, a size or two smallcr
than thc elephant; the lady-bird, the butter-
ssy,-all triumphs of art! consider the goose,
whose feet were so small and whose balance
was so indifferent that he usually tumblcd
forward and knocked down all the animal
creation! consider Noah and his family, like
idiotic t‹›bacco-st‹›ppers; and how the leopard
stuck to warm little fingers; and how the
tails of the larger animals used gradually to
resolve themselves into frayed bits of string.

Hush! Again a forest, and somebody up
