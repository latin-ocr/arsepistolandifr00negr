THE PIOKET GUARD.
C ί ALL quiet along the Potomac‚'' they say, As he mutters a prayer for the children asleep,

'⁵‘ Except now and then a stray picket
Is shot„ as he walks on his beat, to
and fro,

By a rifleman hid in the thioket.
’Tis nothing3 a private or two, now and then,

Will not count in the news of the battle;
Not an officer lost—only one of the men,
Moaning out, all alone, the death rattle.’'

All quiet along the Potomac izo-night,

XVhere the soldiers lie peaeefully dreaming;

Their tents in the rays of the clear autumn
moon,
Or the light of the watoh-fi res, are gleaming.
A tremulous sigh‚ as the gentle night-wind
Through the forest leaves softly is creeping;
While stars up above, with their glittering eyes,
Keep guard—for the army is sleeping.

There's onlgt the sound of the lone seentry's
trea

As he tramps from the rock to the fountain‚
And he thinks of the two in the low trundle-bed‚
Far away in the cot on the mountain.
His musket falls slaek ; his face, dark and grim,

Grows gentle with memories tendet,

The moon seems to shine just as brightly as then,
That night when the love yet unspoken
Leaped up to his lips—when low, murmured¹

vows
Were pledged to be ever unbroken;
Then drawing his sleeve roughly over his eyes,
He dashes off tears that are welling, Ι
And gathers his gun closer up to its place, f
As if to keep down the heart-swelling'. -

He nasses the fountain, the blasted phe-tree—
The footsteps 1s lagging and weary3

Yet onward he goes, through the broad belt of
Tow‘iiglhiihe shades of the forest so dreary. ¹,

It looked like a rifle z “ Ha! Mary, good-byl’''³ .
And the life-blood is ebbing and plashing. ’

All quiet along the Potomac to-night—
No sound save the rush of the river;

While sost falls the dew on the face of the dead Ῐ ·.
The picket’s off duty forever.
