EDWARD EVERETT.
Eminent Classic Writer and Orator.

 

ᾖ i NE of the most famous of American scholars and rhetoricians,
‘ was born in Dorchester, near Boston, in 1794, and at the early
age of thirteen entered Harvard University, where he graduated
in 1811, with an extraordinary reputation for abilities and ac-
quirements. He at first turned his attention to law, but yield-
ing to the wishes of his friends decided to study theology, and
had been two years in the divinity school at Cambridge, when Boston was
thrown into mourning by the death of the youthful and eloquent Buck-
minster, and he was chosen to succeed him as minister of the church in
Brattle Street.

He was now nineteen years of age, and his society, perhaps the
largest and most intellectual in the city, had been accustomed to hear one
of the most remarkable orators of modern times, but his success was still
such as to justify the most sanguine anticipations of his friends. In
addition to his ordinary and arduous professional labors, in the first eight
months of his ministry he wrote and published, in a volume of nearly
five hundred pages, a very able “ Defence of Christianity,'' against a work
which had then just appeared under the title of “The Grounds of Chris-
tianity Examined, by Comparing the New Testament with the Old.''

In 1815, before he was twenty-one years of age, he was elected pro-
fessor of the Greek Language and Literature in the University, with
permission to visit Europe for the improvement of his health, which had
been impaired by severe application to his pastoral duties. Having been
absent about four years and a half, he returned to the United States and
immediately entered upon the duties of his professorship at Cambridge,
where he delivered courses of lectures on the History of Greek Literaa
ture, on Antiquities, and on Ancient Art, and published a Greek Grammar,
from the German of Buttmann, and a Greek Reader, on the basis of the
one by Jacobs.

The “North American Review '' had now passed from the possession
of the club under whose auspices it was established, and at the request ot*

the new proprietors Mr. Everett became its editor. The first number
