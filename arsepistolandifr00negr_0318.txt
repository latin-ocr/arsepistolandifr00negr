The Chinese plate looked very blue
And wailed : ‘⁶ Oh, dear what shall we do ’Β ”
Β111 1116 gingham dog and the 6111160 cat
Wallowed this way and tumbled that,

And utilized every tooth and claw

In the awfulest way you ever saw—
And, oh! how the gingham and 6111160 flew !

( Don't think that Ι exaggerate
I got my news from the Chinese plate.)

EUGENE FIELD.

Next morning where the two had sat
They found no trace of dog or cat;
And some folks think unto this day
That burglars stole that pair away;
But the truth about that cat and pup
Is that they ate each other up—
Now, what do you think of that?

(The old Dutch elock, it told me so,
And that is how I came to know.)

LEEP, little pigeon, and fold your wings— All 51161111 y creeping, it asks: ‘⁴ Is he 5166111ῃὲ-

Little blue pigeon with velvet eyes,
Sleep to the singing of the mother bird
swinging—
Swinging the nest where her little one
lies.

Away out yonder Ι 566 a star—
Silvery star with a tinkling song ;

To the soft dew falling Ι hear it calling—-
Calling and tinkling the night along.

Sleepin g and d reuming while mother sings ?''

Up from the sea there floats the sob
Of the waves that are breaking upon the
shore,
As though they were groaning in anguish
and moaning—
Bemoaning the ship that shall come no more.

But sleep, little pigeon, and sold your wings—
Little blue pigeon with mournful eyes;

In through the window 11 moonbeam comes— Am Ι 1101 singing—see‚ Ι am swinging—

Little gold moonbeam with misty wings ;

Swing the nest where my darling lies.

ΟΝ afternoons, when baby boy 11115 had 11 Τ111 mamma and the nurse agreed it was a

And sits, like any monaroh on his
throne in nurse’s lap,
In 11115 peouliar wise I hold my ’kerchief to
my face,
And cautiously and quietly I move about the
place:
Then‚ with a cry, I suddenly expose my face
to view,
And you should hear him laugh and erow
when I saw “ Βοο11 1 ”

Sometimes that rasoal tries to make believe
that he is scared,

And, really, when I first began, he stared and
stared and stared ;

“ eruel shame.’'

But now what does the same wee, toddling,
lisping buby (10
