THE ENTRY OF OOR'I'EZ.
FROM “THE FAIR GOD.²‘

T is hardly worth while to eulogize the
Christians who took part in Cortcz' cru-
sade. History has assumed their com-

memoration. I may say, however, they were
men who had acquired fitness for the task by
service in almost every clime. Some had
tilted with the Moor under the walls of
Grenada; some had fought the Islamite on
the Blue Danube3 some had performed the
first Atlantic voyage with Columbus; all of
them had hunted the Carib in the glades of
Hispaniola. It is not enough to describe
them as fortune hunters, credulous, imagina-
tive, tireless; neither is it enough to write
them soldiers, bold, skillful, confident, crue]
to enemies, gentle to each other,

They were characters of the age in which

they lived, unseen before, unseen since;
knights errant, who believed in hippogriff and

 

dragon, but sought them only in lands of
gold3 missionaries who complacently broke
the body of the converted that Christ might
the sooner receive his soul; palmers of pike
and shield, who, in care of the Virgin‚ followed
the morning round the world, assured that
Heaven stooped lowest over the most profita-
ble plantations.

The wonders of the way from the coast to
Iztapalapan had 30 beguiled the little host
that they took but partial account of its dan-
gers. VVhen‚ this morning, they stepped
upon the causeway and began to march out
into the lake, a sense cf insecurity fell upon
them like the shadow of 11 cloud ; back 10 1110
land they looked, as to a friend from whom
they might be parting forever; and as they
proceeded and the waters spread around them,
wider, deep, and upbearing denser multitudcs
