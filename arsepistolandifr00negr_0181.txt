‘rHOMAS BUCHANAN READ.

There bnbbles the shady spring below,

With its bulrush brook where the hazels gr‹›w;
‘Twas there I found the calamus-root,

And watched the minnows poise and shoot‚
And heard the robin lave his wing‚

But the stranger’s bucket is at the spring.

Oh, ye who daily cross the sill,

Step lightly, for I love it still ;

And when you crowd the old barn caves,
Then think what countless harvest sheaves
Have passed within that scented door

To gladden eyes that are no inore l

Deal kindl y with these orchard trees ;

And when your children crowd their knees,
Their sweetest fruit they shall impart,

As if old memories stirred their heart ;

To youthful sport still leuve the swing,
And in sweet reverence hold the spring.

The barn, the trees, the brook, the birds,
The meadows with their lowing herds,
The woudbine on the cottage wall——

My heart still lingers with then all.

Ye strangers on my native sill,

Step lighssy, for I love it still !

 

THE CLOSING· SOENE.

The following is pronounced by the “ XVestminster Review '’ 10 be unquestionably the finest

American poem ever written.

ITHIN this sober realm of leafless trees, ·

The rnsset yearinhaled the dreamy air,

Like some tanned reaper in his hour of

Wheffffl, the fields are lying brown and
are.

The gray barns looking from their hazy 111115
Ο’01 1110 dim waters widening in the vales,
Sent down the air a greeting 1ο 1110 mills,
On the dull thunder of alternate fiails.

All sights were mellowed and all sounds sub-
The lllifig’seemed further and the streams
sang low ;
As in a dream the distant woodman hewed
His winter log with many a niuffled blow.

The embattled forests, erewhile armed in gold
Their banners bright with every martial hue,

Now stood, like some sad, beaten host of old,
Withdrawn afar in time's remotest blue.

On sombre wings the vulture tried his flight,
The dove scarce heard his sighing mate's
complaint,
And, like a star slow drowning in the light,
The village church-vane seemed to pale and
faint.

The sentinel eock upon the hill-side 01011-
Crew thrice‚ and all was stiller than before-—

 

Silent till some replying wanderer blew
His alien horn, and then was heard no more.

Made garrulous trouble round the unfledged

And ivliygssnighe oriole hung her swaying nest
By every light wind like a censer swung ;

XVhere sang the noisy masons of the eaves,
The busy swallows circling ever near,

Foreboding‚ as the rustic mind believes,
An early harvest and a plenteous year;

Where every bird which charmed the vernal

All now were songless, empty, and 10110111.

Alone, from out the stubble, piped the quail,
And croaked the crow through all the
dreamy gloom,
Alone the pheasant, drumming in the vale,
Made echo to the distant cottage loom.

There was no bud, no bloom upon the bowers3
The spiders wove their thiu shrouds night
