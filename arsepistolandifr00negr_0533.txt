ROBERT BROWNING. 4235

(So tight he kept his lips compressed, Perched him !'’ The chief 's eye flashed ;
Scarce any blood came through,) Soared up again like fire.

Yon lOOked tWice er? you saw his brea& The chief ’s eye flashed ; but presently his
WaS au but ShOt m two‘ Softened itself, as sheathes [plans

“Well‚’' cried he, “Emperor, by God’s grace A film the mother eagle's eye
We’ve got you Ratisbon ! When her bruised eaglet breathes :

The marshal's in the market-place, “You're wounded 2 '' “Nay‚'' his soldier’s
And you'll be there anon Touched to the quick‚ he said : [pride

To see your flag-bird flap his vans “ I'm killed, sire! ’' And, his chief beside,
Where I, to heart's desire, Smiling, the boy fell dead.

 

THE MOTH’S KISS, FIRST!

HE Moth's kiss, first! The Bee's kiss, now!
Kiss me as if you made believe Kiss me as if you entered gay
You were not sure, this eve, My heart at some noonday,
How my face, your flower, had pursed A bud that dared not disallow
Its petals up3 so, here and there The claim, so all is rendered up,
You brush it, till I grow aware And passively its shattered cup
Who wants me, and wide open burst. Over your head to sleep Ι bow.

ONE WAY OF LOVE.

LL June Ι bound the rose in sheaves; Ι She will not hear my music? So l
Now, rose by rose, Ι strip the leaves, Break the string——fold music’s wing.
And strewthemwhere Pauline may pass, Suppose Pauline had bade me sing!

She will not turn aside‘? Alas!
Let them lie. Suppose they die?
The chance was they might take her eye.

My whole life long I learned to love3
This hour my utmost art Ι prove
And speak my passion—Heaxen or hell?

How many a month Ι strove to suit She will not give me heaven ἶ) ’Tis well—-
These stubborn fingers to the lute ἔ Lose who may—I still cau say,
To·day I venture all I know. Those who win in heaven, blest are they.

EVELYN HOPE.
EAUTIFUL Evelyn Hope is dead! It was not her time to love; beside,

Sit and watch by her side an hour. Her life had many a hope and aim,
That is her bookshelf, this is her bed ; Duties enough and little cares,
She plucked that piece of geranium fiower, And now was quiet, now astir,
Beginning to die, too, in the glass; Till God’s hand beckoned unawares—
Little has been changed, Ι think : And the sweet white brow is all of her.

The shutters are shut, no light may pass

Save two long rays through the hinge’s chink· IS it tOO late then, Evelyn HOpe ἶ)
What, your soul was pure and true,

Sixteen years old when she died! The good stars met in your horoscope,
Perhaps she had scarcely heard my name ; Made you of spirit, fire and dew—
