1ῐῦ EDGAR ALLAN POE. -

Caught from some unhappy master
Whom unmereiful disaster
Followed fast and followed faster,
Till 1113 songs 0110 bui-den bore—
Till the dirges of his hope
That melancholy burden bore

Of ‘N evermore ’—of ‘ N evei-more. ’ ''

But the raven still beguiling

All my sad 30111 into smiling,

straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in
Front of bird and 111131 and door;

Then upon 1110 velvet sinking,

Ι 1101001( myself 10 linking

Faney 111110 fancy, thinking
What this 0101110113 bird of 17010-

11711111 11113 grim, ungainly, ghastly,
Graunt and 0111100113 bird of yore
Meant in eroaking “ Neve1·more.‘’

This I sat engaged 111 guessing,
But no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now
Bul-ned into my bosom’s eore;
This and more I sat ‹livining‚
With my head at ease reclining
On the eushion's velvet lining
T hat 1110 lamplight gloated 0’01;
But whose velvet violet lining
With the lamplight gloating o’er,
She shall press, ah, never more !

Then, methought 1110 air grew denser,

Perfumed from an unseen 000301,

Swung by angele whose faint foot-falls
Tinkle 011 1110 tusted floor.

‘¹ 11Ῑ101011,” Ι (nied, “thy God hath lentthee‚

By these angols he hath sent 11100

Respite—respite and nepenthe
From thy 0100101103 of Lenorel

Qunff, oh, quaff 11113 kind nepenthe,
And forgot 11113 1031 Lenore 1 ”
Quoth the raven, “ Nevermore 1 ”

’“’ prophet! '' said I⁷ “ thing of evil 1·-
Prophet still, if bird or devil!

Ι

Whether tempest sent, or whether
Tempest tossed thee here ashore,

Desolate yet all undaunted,

On this desert lam! 0110111101οᾶ-

On 11113 home hy horror haunted—

Tell me truly, Ι implore—

Ι3 there—i< 111010 balm in Gilead?
Το11-1110-1011 me, I implore! ”
Quoth the raven, “ Nevermore.”

“ Prophet Ι ” said I, “ thing of evil—

Propl1‹-t still, if bird or devil l·—

By than heaven that bends above us·—
By that God we both adore—

Tell this 30111 with sorrow laden

If, within 1110 distant Afflenn,

It shall elasp a sainted maiden
VVhom the angele name 1100010-

Clasp a rare and radiant maiden
VVhom the angels name Lenore.”
Quoth 1110 raven, “ Nevermore.”

“ Be that word our sign of parting,

Bird or fiend 1 ” Ι 3111101(οᾱ, upstarting—

“Get thee back into the tempest

And the night’s Plutonian shore!
Lcave no blaek plume as a token

Of that lie thy 30111 bath spoken!
Leave my 1000110033 110111οκ00 1-
Quit 1110 111131 above my door!
Take thy beak from 0111 my heart,
And take thy form from off my door! ”’
Quoth the raven, “ Ν evermore.”

And the raven, never flitting‚

Still 13 sittim, 31111 13 sitting

On the pallid 111131, of Pallas
Just above my ehamber door;

And 1113 eyes have all the seeming

Of a demon that 13 dreaming,

And 1110 lamplight o’er him streaming
Throws his shadow on the floor;

And my 30111 from out that shadow
That lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted—nevermore!
