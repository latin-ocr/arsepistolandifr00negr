pence is no bad day’s work. Come, let us
have it, then.”

“I have brought back no money,'' cried
Moses again; “ I have laid it all out in a bar-
gain, and here it is,’' pulling out a bundle
from his breast3 “here they are; a gross of
green spectacles, with silver rims and shagreen
easeS.’'

“ A gross of green spectacles 1 ’² repeated my
wife in a faint voice. “ And you have parted
with the colt‚ and brought us back nothing
but a gross of green paltry spectacles 1 ’'

‘⁴ Dear mother‚'' cried the boy, ‘⁵ why won't
you‘ listen to reason? I had them a dead bar-
gain, or Ι should not have bought them. The
silver rims alone will sell for double the
money.''

“ A fig for the silver rims 1 '¹ cried my wife,
in a passion. “I dare swear they won’t sell
for above half the money at the rate of broken
silver‚ five shillings an ounce.’'

“ You need be under no uneasiness,’' cried
I, “about selling the rims, for they are not
worth sixpenee‚ for Ι perceive they are only
eopper varnished over.''

‘⁶ What! ’³ cried my wife, “not silver! the
rIms not silver ! ’'

“ No‚'' eried I, “ no more silver than your
saucepan.”

green spectacles, with copper rims and shagreen

blockhead has been imposed upon, and should
have known his company better !”

“ There, my dear,'’ eried I, “ you are wrong ;

“ Marry, hang the idiot1 ’⁷ returned she, “to
bring me such stuff. If I had them, I would
throw them in the fire.’'

“ There again you are wrong, my dear‚'’
cried I: “ for though they be copper, we will
keep them by us, as copper spectacles, you
know, are better than nothing.''

By this time the unfortunate Moses was
undeceived. He now saw that he had been
imposed upon by a prowling sharper, who
observing his figure, had marked him for an
easy prey. Ι therefore asked him the circum-
stances of his deception.

He sold the horse, it seems, and walked the
fair in search of another„ A reverend-looking
man brought him to a tent under pretence of
having one to sell. “ He1·e,” continued Moses,
“ we met another man, very well dressed, who
desired to borrow twenty pounds upon these,
saying that he wanted money, and would dis-
pose of them for a third of their value. The
first gentleman, who pretended to be my friend,
whispercd to me to buy them, and cautioned
me not to let so good an offer pass. Isent for
Mr. Flarnborough, and they talked him up as
finely as they did 1ne; and so at last we were
persuaded to buy the two gross between us.''
