you call it—yet, and I'm told that there is
not a man living so amiable or philosophical,
but that a poor ‹linner provokes a martyr-like

{smile and piquancy of manner that seemed
peculiarly brilliant against the background of
her deep and repressed feeling, she left him.

He tried to return to his work, but found
himself once more possessed by the demon of
unrest and impatience. The spiritual wave
that had been lifting him higher and higher
was changing its character aud becoming a
smoothly gliding current. It was so irresisti-
ble that 116 116161 thought of resisting. Why
should he resist? he asked himself.

Circumstances had interested him in this
rare Undine before she received a woman’s
soul ; circumstances had entangled his life and
hers in what had almost been an awful
tragedy3 and now circumstances, or some-
thing far beyond, were swistly developing
before his eyes a spiritual 10161111655 11131 was
the counterpart of her outward beauty, and he
assured himself that it would be the greatest
folly of his life to lose 3 11366 of the exquisite
process that he might be privileged to see.
What artist or poet 1135 not pictured to him-
self the fair face of Eve as God first breathed
into her perfect clay the breath of life, or has
not, in imagination, seen the closed eyes open·
ing iu surprise and intelligence or kindling
with the light of love?

And yet the change in Ida Mayhew seemed
to Van Berg far more wonderful and interest-
ing; and to his fancy if, instead of lying in
the beauty of her breathless‚ statuesque prepa-
ration for life, Eve had been possest by a
legion of distorting imps, she would have been
the type of the maiden he first had recognized.
But he had seen these evil spirits exorcised,
and in their place was coming a noble,
womanly soul—sweet, tender, and strong—
and the perfect form and features seemed but
a transparent mould‚ a crystal vase into which
heaven was pouring 3 new and divine life.

of the past? Thus his philosophical mind
was able once more to reason the whole mat-
ter out clearly and prove that his wish to
annihilate the intervening hours before he
could dare to present himself to Ida Mayhew,
was the most natural and proper desire imag-
inable. He concluded that a walk through
Central Park might banish his disquietude,
and leave time for 3 careful toilet, since for
some occult reason 1116 occasion seemed to him
to require unusual preparation.

He knew he was unfashionably early when ⁷
he rang Mr. Mayhew's door-bell, but he had'
found it impossible to curb his impatience to
see in what new aspect Ida would present her-
self that evening. A hundred times he had
queried how she would appear in her own
home, how she would preside 35 11051655, and
whether the taste of the florid and fashionable
mother would not be so apparent as to annoy
him like a bad tone in the picture. It be- ⁷
came evident that the worshipper of beauty 1
was in the presence of his divinity, and his 1
every glance burned incense to her honor. ¹

She had twined a few rose-leaves in her
hair, but wore no other ornament save the
rose he had given her in the morning, which
evidently had been kept carefully for the
occasion, for it was unchanged, with the
exception that it revealed its heart a little
more openly, as did Ida herself. And yet she
did her best to insure that her manner should
be no more cordial than her character of
hostess demanded.

But in spite of all she could do, the light of
exultation and intense joy would flash into
her eyes and tremble in her tones that eve-
ning. A maiden would have been blind
indeed had she not been able to read the rid-
dle of Van Berg's ardent friendship now, and
Ida had seen that expression too often not to
know its meaning well. In the morning she
had strongly hoped, now she believed. She
no longer walked by faith but in full vision,
and she trod with the grace of a queen who
knows her power in the realm that woman
loves best.
