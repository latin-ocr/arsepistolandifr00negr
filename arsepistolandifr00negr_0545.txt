LORD BYRON. 497

And when thou wouldst solace gather‚
When our ehild's first aceents fiow,

Wilt thou teaeh her to say “ Father 1 ''
Though his care she must forego?

When her little hands shall press thee,
When her lip to thine is pressed,

Think of him whose prayer shall bless thee,
Think of him thy love had blessed!

Should her lineaments resemble
Those thou nevermore mayst see,

Then thy heart will softly tremble
With a pulse yet true to me.

All my faults perchanee thou knowest,
All my madness none can know ;

All my hopes, where'er thou goest,
Whither, yet with thee they go.

Every feeling hath been shaken 3
Pride‚ which not a world could bow,
Bows to thee—by thee forsaken,
Even my soul forsakes me now;

But 't is done 3 all words are idle——
VVords from me are vainer still;

But the thoughts we cannot bridle
F oree their way without the will.

Fare thee well l—thus disunited,
Torn from every nearer tie,

Seared in heart, and lone, and blighted,
More than this I scarae can die.

NHAPPY White! while life was in its

The spoiler came, and all thy promise fair

She sowed the seeds, but death has reaped the

 

So the struck eagle, stretehed upon the plain,

No more through rolling clouds to soar

Viewed iiis own feather on the fatal dart,

And winged the shaft that quivers at his

Keen were his pangs; but keener far to feel

NAPOLEON.

9 TIS done—but yesterday a king!
And armed with kings to strive—
And now thou art a nameless thing;

So abject—yet alive!
Is this the man of thousand thrones,
Who strewed our earth with hostile bones,
And can he thus survive?
Since he, misealled the Morning Star,
Nor man nor fiend hath fallen so far.

Ill-minded man! why scourge thy kind
Who bowed so low the knee?
By gazing on thyself grown blind,

Thou taught'st the rest to see.

With might unquestioned——power to save—
'l‘hine only gift hath been the grave

To those that worshipped thee:
Nor till thy fall could mortals guess
Ambition's less than littleness!

Thanks for that lesson—it will teach
To after warriors more

Thau high philosophy ean preaeh‚
And vainly preaehed before.

That spell upon the minds of men

Breaks never to unite again,
That led them to adore

Those Pagod things of sabre sway,

With fronts of brass and feet of clay.
