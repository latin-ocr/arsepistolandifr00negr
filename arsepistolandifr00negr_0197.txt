THE WONDERFUL

AVE you heard of the wonderful one-

H hoss shay,
That was built in such a logical way

’ It ran a hundred years to a day,
And then, of a sudden, it—-Ah, but stay,
I’ll tell you what happened, without delay—
Scaring the parson into fits,
Frightening people out of their wits—
Have your ever heard of that, I say?

Seventeen hundred and fifty-five,

Georqius Secundus was theu alive—

Snuffy old drone from the German hive.
That was the year when Lisbon town

Saw the earth open and gulp her down,
And Braddock’s army was done so brown,
Left without a scalp to its crown.

It was ou the terrible earthquake-day

That the deacon finished the one-hoss shay.
Now, in building of chaises, I tell you what,
There is always, somewhere, a weakest spot——
In hub, tire, felloe, in spring or thill,

In panel or crossbar, or floor, or sill,

In screw, bolt, thoroughbraee—lurking still,
F ind it somewhere you must and will—
Above or below, or within or without—
And that’s the reason, beyond a doubt,

A chaise breaks down, but doesn't wear out.

But the deacon swore—(as deacons do,

With an “ Ι dew vum '’ or an “I tell yeou‚'')
He would build one shay to beat the taown

⁷ ’N’ the keounty 'n’ all the kentry raon' ;

[t should be so built that it couldn' break

daown ;

“ ONE-HOSS SHAY.”

“ Fur‚'’ said the deacon, ‘⁶ 't’s mighty plain
That the weakes’ place mus’ stan' the strain
'N' the way t' fix it, uz I maintain,

Is only jest
To make that place uz strong uz the rest.''

So the deacon inquired of the village folk

XVhere he could find the strongest oak,

That could n't be split, nor bent, nor 1110110-

That was for spokes, and floor, and sills;

He sent for lancewood, to make the thills;

The crossbars were ash, from the straightest
trees ;

The panels of white-wood‚ that cuts like cheese,

But lasts like iron for things like these;

The hubs from logs from the “ Settler's ellum,''

Last of its timber—they couldn't sell 'em—

N ever an ax had seen their chids‚

And the wedges flew from between their lips,

Their blunt ends frizzled like celery-tips;

Step and prop-iren, bolt and screw,

Spring, tire, axle, and linchpin too,

Steel of the finest, bright and blue;

T horoughbrace bison-skin, thick and wide;

Boot, top, dasher, from tough old hide,

Found in the pit where the tanner died.

That was the way he “ put her through.”

‘⁶ There !'' said the deacon‚ “naow she’ll dew!’'

Do 3 I tell you, I rather guess

She was a wonder, and nothing else!

Colts grew horses, beards turned gray,
Deacon and deaconess dropped away,
Children and grandchildren—-where were they?
But there stood the stout old one-hoss shay,
As fresh as on Lisbon-earthquake-day!
