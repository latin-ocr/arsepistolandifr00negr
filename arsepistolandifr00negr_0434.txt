“ And this one resolve you should cherish like
old

—It hasgevei* my life and endeavor 001111οΠ011,-

If fortune assailed, and worst comes to worst,

And business proves bad, its bubbles all burst,
Be resolved, if disaster your plans circum-

vent,

That you will, if you fail, owe no one a

cent.''

BENJAMIN P. smLLAssER.

There was Bunsby's deep wisdom revealed in
his tone,

Though its depth was hard to fathom I own,

“ For how can J fail,'' I said to myself‚

“If to pay all my debts I have enough pelf?'’

Then I scratched my sinciput, battling for light,

But gave up the effert, supposing 'twas right;

And herein give out, as my earnest intent,

Whenever I fass. to owe no man a cent.

JOHN SMI'I'H’S W1LL.

ow, Mr. Smith, who had taken his leave,

lVas a prudentish sort of a man ;

Aud Smith from the fountain,
And Smith from the cart;

He always said to prevent, not retrieve, From the furthest off to the very near,

lVas far the properest plan ;

So, to hinder lieart-burning and jealous hate,
And contending heirs make still,

Before he surrendered himself to fate
He prudently framed a will.

But kept it shut from mortal look,
Nor could any define its tone3

To the favored to-be ’twas a close-sealed book,
As well as the destined-to-none.

So hope ran strong and hope hope ran high
In every degree of kin ;

For virtues of Smith was breathed many a sigh,
But smiles were reserved for his tin.

Nor wife nor child
On Smith had e’er smiled,
To inherit the money for which he had toiled ;
And he'd no nearer kin than uncles 0100113103-
But these he had in numberless dozens.
Now cold was his clay,
And appointed [he (lay
XVhen his will was to open in legal way; [all
And the summons was put in the “ Post,'' and
Of the “ next of kin '' were invited to call,
To see what share to their lot would fall 3
And every heir
Had assembled there
From the sea and land, and from everywhere :
There was Smith from the plain,
And Smith from the still,
And smith froin the main,
And Smith from 1110 mill,
And szth from the nuumtaiu,
And Sinith from the mart,

 

The Smiths all came the will to hear.

And they soberly sat

In neighborly chat,

Talking all about this and that,

While the clock by the door

VVas watched more and more

As the minute-hand neared the hour of four—

The hour set when the opening seal

Their joy or their chagrin would reveal.

“ Watch a pot and ’twill never boil,''

Hasten time—'tis an up-hill toil;

W'atch a clock for the hour to go—

Tis the weariest work a man can know;

And thus as they watched their patience waned,

Though not a voice of the mass complained.

For they thought it wouldn’t be prudent to ,
show [know.

That they were aught anxious their doom to

Four struck at last, and, in eager array,
They gathered around an old man gray,
Who straightway out from its iron nook
Mr. Smith's very “last will '' then took,
Nicely with black tape strongly tied,
With a huge black seal on either side.
The click of the shears, as the threads did. part, .
VVent with a thrill to each waiting heart,
And then with anxious ear they hung
Upon every word of the old man's tongue.
His “soundness of mind ''

And his creed were defined,

And then came the names to whom 110 wass
kind:
