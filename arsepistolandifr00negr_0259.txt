JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY. 211

Over the name of “ Benj amin F. Johnson, of Boone‚'' he began, about
the year 187 5, to contribute verses in the Hoosier dialect to the Indian-
apolis paperS. These attracted considerable attention, suggesting an
interesting field of literature, which he resolved, sooner or later, to occupy.
It was evident that dialect poems were relished by the public, and as these
were written upon subjects near at hand, and such as appealed to the
popular heart‚ Mr. Riley found himself growing in favor, and from that
day has continued in active literary work.

He is gifted in the art of imitation, which was shown by his writing
a piece after the style of Edgar Allen Poe that was accepted by many
critics as the work of that author. Such a seat as this required something
more than ordinary talent. In addition to many dialect pieces, he has
published poems of a more serious character, proving that he possesses
ability for the graver as well as the lighter strains of thought and
feeling.

He has issued a number of volumes, including “The Old Swimmin'
Hole‚’' “Afterwhiles,'' “ Neighborly Poems,’' “ Pipes o' Pan‚'‘ ‘² Green
Fields and Runniug Brooks,'' “Rhymes of Childhood,” “The Flying
Islands of the Night,'' and others. His works abound in pictures of
Western life, and around the most commonplace objects he throws a
peculiar charm. Like the ballads of Carlton, many of his songs deal
with the farm, the old homestead‚ the old arm-chair, the boys who whistle
and shout and play, and the old people whose eyes are already growing
dim and whose forms are bending toward the grave. While his writings
are intended to engage the attention of the reader and furnish entertain-
ment, they are nearly always pointed with a moral, and there is some-
thing worth storing in the memory.

No one could form an accurate estimate of Mr. Riley's writings and
leave out what may be called the human element that is always promi-
nent. There is no attempt to reach the towering heights of the English
poets of earlier times. No stately measures of verse appeal to the most
cultivated mind and arouse the admiration always accorded to genius.
There is, however, a genius less commanding and imposing. Mr. Riley
descends into the common walks of life, and makes himself at home with
’ ordinary people. His language is so simple, his meaning is so clearly
comprehended, there is such an evident comprehension of everyday life,
that not as a stranger‚ but as a friend, does he step into the home. He is
much sought after as a lecturer and reader of his own productions.
