ξ γ’· ’ R. MOTLEY was born April 15, 1814, 31 Dorchester, now a
s v ’ part of Boston, and graduated at Harvard University 111 1831.

1 ’ , ¹ Having spent two years 111 Germany and travelled for a time, ”
‘5³ - Α chiefly in Italy, he returned to America in 1834, where he
became a student of law and ultimately was called to the bar.
In 1841 he received his first diplomatic appointment, being
made Secretary of Legation to the Russian mission, but finding the
atmosphere of St. Petersburg uncongenial, he resigned his post within a
few months and definitely resolved on a literary career.

About the year 1846 1110 project of writing a History of Holland Ἰ
had begun to take shape in his mind, and he had already prepared a con-
siderable quantity of manuscript, when, finding the materials at his dis-
90531 111 1110 United States quite inadequate for 1110 completion of his work,
he resolved to migrate to Europe along with 1115 family 111 1851. The
next five years were spent at Berlin, Dresden, Brussels and the Hague in
laborious investigation of the archieves preserved in those capitals, and
resulted in 1856 111 1110 publication of “The Rise of the Dutch Republic,
a History,'' comprised in three volumes 311(1 published in London and
New York.

This work, which, after a large historical introduction, minutely
follows the history of the Low Countries from the abdication of Charles 111
1555 down to the assassination of William the Silent in 1584, immediately
became highly popular by its graphio manner and the warm and sympa- ’
thetic spirit in which it was written, while at the same time it was frankly ”
recognized by scholars as a painstaking and conscientious piece of
original work. It speedily passed through many English editions, was⁵ ¹
translated into French and also into Dutch, as well as into German and ·· “
Russian. Pursuing his researches in England, France‚ Belgium and ,
Holland, Motley was able to publish in 1860 the two volumes of the, ¹
“ History of the United Netherlands,’' covering the period from the death? ¹

of William the Silent in 1584 to shortly after the destruction of the, .
