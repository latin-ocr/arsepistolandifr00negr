EUGENE FOELD„
Child-Lover and Poet.

>ss ς] ΗΕΝ Dr. Arnold of Rugby was asked why he always took off
‘² his hat to his scholars‚ he replied, “Some of these boys will
be members of Parliament, perhaps prime-ministers, or dis-
tinguished authors and scientists. Why should 1 not bow

to these future celebrities?'' Eugene Field had the same
respect and love for children, and all who knew him paid him
back with a love that almost amounted to idolatry.

He was born in St. Louis, Missouri‚ September 2, 1850. His parents
were Vermont people 3 his father a lawyer, and his mother a gentlewoman
of beautiful character. At six years of age, Eugene Field was left mother-
less. He cherished with a tender heart the precious memory of his
mother. “ My little mother, who left 1110 when 1 was six years old,‘’ he
would say. ‘⁶ Oh, if my mother, my clear mother. had but lived to feel a
little, just a little proud of her boy.''

At the death of the mother, Eugene, together with his brothers, was
sent “ back east ’' to Massachusetts and put under the care of Miss
French, a maiden cousin of the father, ancl a most noble character she
was. Here the poet remained until he was nineteen years of age. Of
this period he says, <a These were the sweetest and finest days of my life.

Ι love old Amherst.”
Eugene Field, as a child, was most precocious When nine years of

age he was sent to Fayetteville, Vermont, to the old homesteacl where his
grandmother lived. This visit extended over a period of seven months.

Of this visit, Field said, “ We, my brothers and 1, stayed there seven
months, and the old lady got all the grandson she wanted. She didn‘t
want the visit repeated.’' This grandinother was a New England Con-

 

gregationalist of the strictest sort. She used to encourage Eugene to
write little sermons, paying him ten cents for each sermon he wrote.
The first one of these sermons was kept by Field until the end of his life.
It was composed of several sheets of note paper, beautifully bound in cloth.

Mr. Field was not a college man. At sixteen years of age, he was
