Yet, with strong yearning and passionate pain y

Long I to-night for your presence again,
Come from the silence so long and so deep ;--
Rock me to sleep, mother,—rock me to sleepl

Over my heart in the days that are flown,
No love like mother-love ever has shone;

No other worship abides and endures,—
Fatithful, unselfish, aud patient like yours:
None like a mother can charin away pain
From the sick soul and the world—weary brai 11.
Slumber's soft calms o’er my heavy lids creep;
Rock me to sleep, mother‚—rock me to sleep !

Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with
Fau ongyhciiir shoulders again as of old;

 

ELIZABETH ACKERS ALLEN.

Let it drop over my forehead to—night,

Shading my faint eyes away from the light3
For with its sunny—edged shadows once more
Haply will throng the sweet visions of ’ yore;
Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep ;—

Rock me to sleep mother,-—rock me to sleepl '

Mother, dear mother, the years have been ‚⁴

Since ΙΙῗέεῗ listen'd your lullaby song:
Sing, then, and unto my soul it shall seem

lVomanhood's years have been only a dream. 'q

Clasp'd to your heart in a loving embrace,
With your light lashes just sweeping my ⁸
Never hzssiaster to wake or to weep 3—

Rock me to sleep, mother,—rock me to sleep

LEF'T BEHIND.

OU did not see the the bitter trace

Of anguish sweep across my face ;

You did not hear my proud heart beat,
Heavy and slow, beneath your feet ;
You thought of triumphs still unwon,
Of glorious decds as yet undone ;
And I, the while you talked to me,
l watched the gulls float lonesomely,
Till lost amid the hungry blue‚
And loved you better than you knew.

You wulk the sunny side of fate;

The wisc world smiles, and calls you great ;
T hc golden fruitugc of success

Drops at your feet in plenteousness ;

And you have blessings manifold :

chown and power and friends and gold,
They build a wall between us twain,
Which may not be thrown down again,
Aias! for I, the long years through,

Have loved you better than you knew.

Your life's proud aim, your art’s high truth, ⁴
Have kept the promise of your youth ; '⁸
And while you won the crown, which now
Breaks into bloom upon your brow,

My soul cried strongly out to you

Across the ocean’s yearning blue‚

While, unremembered and afar,

Ι watched you, as I watch a star
Through darkness struggling into view,
And loved you better than you knew.

I used to dream in all these years

Of patient faith and silent tears,

That Love's strong haud would put aside
The barriers of place and pride,

Would reach the pathless darkness through,

And draw me softly up to you ;

But that is past. If you should stray
Beside my grave, some future day,
Pei-chance the violets o’er my dust
Will half betray their buried trust,
And say, their blue eyes full of dew,

“ She loved you better than you knew.''
