All the blue Bonnets are bound for the Come to the crag where the beacon is blazing,

Border.
Many a banner spread,
Flutters above your head,
Many a erest that is famous in story.
Mount and make ready, then,
Sons of the mountain glen,
Fight for the Queen and our old Scottish glory.

Come with the buckler, the lace, and the bow,
Trumpets are sounding,

war-steeds are bounding, .

Stand to your arms and march in good order, .

England shall many a day
Tell of the bloody fray,
When the Blue Bonnets come over the Border

 

GATHERING SONG OF

IBROCH of Donuil Dhu,
Pibroch of Donuil,
WVake thy wild voice anew,
Summon Otan Conuil,
Come away, come away.
Hark to the summonsl
Come in your war array,
Gentles and comgnons.

Come from deep glen, and
From mountain so rocky ;

The war-pipe and pennon
Are at Inverlocky.

DONALD THE BLAGK.

Come every hill-plaid, and
True beart that wears one,

Come every steel blade, and
Strong hand that bears one.

Leave untended the herd,
The flock without shelter3
Leave the corpse uninterred,
The bride at the altar;
Leave the dear, leave the steer.
Leave nete and barges3
Come with your fighting gear,
Broadswords and targes.
