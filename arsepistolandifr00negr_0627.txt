PERCY BYssHE SHELLEY.

Renowned Poet.

   
  

ζ’ &ai HELLEY was a brilliant light in the literary firmament, and
, although destined soon to set, the beams of his glowing genius
ἒ x} 2 still linger and excite admiration akin to wonder. Leigh Hunt
*7532 says concerning his “Ode to a Skylark‚“ “ a little song yet it
ι v fills all heaven.'' Few men ever possessed the poetic gift in a
higher degree.

Shelley was born in Sussex county, England, in August, 1792, and
lost his life by drowning at Leghorn‚ Italy, in July, 1822 ; yet this youth
whose career was cut off at the early age of thirty left an imperishable name
in the world of letters. His poetry was inspired by au ardent passion for
truth and an ardent love of humanity.

Shelley's most celebrated productions are “ Queen Mab,’‘ “ The
Revolt of Islam,’' “ Rosalind and Helen‚” “ Prometheus Unbound‚'’ and
“ Adonais.’‘ Of Shelley it might have been said, as of his own skylark:

   

“ And singing still (lost suar,
And soaring ever singeth.’'

THE GLOUD.

sse exquisite beauty, delicate fancy and peerless imagination exhibited in this poem
have rendered it one of the elassics, a permanent, immortal production, in English literature.
If Shelley had lived he might have become the master poet of modern times. His exalted

rank is unquestioned.

BRING fresh showers for the thirsting And then again I dissolve it in rain,
flowers, And laugh as Ι pass in thunder.
From the seas and the streams; ’
Ι bear light shade for the leaves when laid
In their noonday dreams,
From my wings are shaken the dews that
waken
The sweet buds every one,
‘Vhen “³⁰de to rest ΟΠ their mother's breaSt’ In a eavern under is fettered the thunder,

As she dances about the sun. It stmggles and howls at fitS3
Ῑ Wield the flail Of the lashiflg hail, Over earth and ocean, with gentle motion,
And whiten the green plains under; This pilot is guiding me.

Ι sist the snow on the mountains below,
And their great pines grown aghast3

And all the night 'tis my pillow white,
While Ι sleep in the arms of the blast.

Sublime on the towers of my skyey bowers,
Lightning, my pilot, sits;
