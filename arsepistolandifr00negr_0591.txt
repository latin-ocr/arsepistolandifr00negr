my wife to J emimarann, who had a pretty
knowledge of the language by this time.

“ Ι don't know what ‘Sam-istie ' means,
mamma; but the Baron asked Madame what
she was doing here ; and Madame said, ‘ And
you, Chicot, you are no more a General at
Franco.’——Have I not translated rightly,
Madame ἶ) ”

“ Oui, mon οῙιοῖι, mon aozgye, Yase, my
angel, my cabbage‚ quite right. Figure your·
self, I have known my dear Chicot dis twenty

earS.''
y “ Chicot is my name of baptism‚'' says the
Baron; “ Baron Chicot de Punter is my name.''

“ And being a General at Franco‚'' says
Jemmy‚ “means, I suppose, being a French
Genera] ‘?'’

‘⁴ Yes‚ I vaS‚’' said he, “ Genera] Baron de
Punter—n’est-'a pas, Amenaide 2 ''

“ Oh, yes 1 '' said Madame Flicfiac‚ and
laughed3 and I and Jemmy laughed out of
politeness : and a pretty laughing matter it
was, as you shall hear.

About this time my J emmy became one of
the Lady-Patronesses of that admirable institu-
tion, “The VVasherwoman's-Orphans' Home; ''
Lady de Sudley was the great projector of it 3
and the manager and chaplain, the excellent
and reverend Sidney Slopper. His salary as
chaplain‚ and that of Doctor Leitch, the
physician (both cousins of her ladyship’s),
drew away five hundred pounds from the six
subscribed to the Charity : and Lady de Sud-
ley thought a fete at Benlah Spa, with aid of
some of the foreign princes who were in town
last year, might bring a little more money into
its treasury. A tender appeal was accordingly
drawn up, and published in all the papers:

“ APPEAL.

“ BRITISH WASHERWOMAN'S-ORPHANS' HOME.

‘⁶ The Washerwoman's-Orphans’ Home has
now been established seven years, and the
good which it> has effected is, it may be
confidently stated, inealeulable. Ninety-eight
orphan children of XVasherwomen have been
lodged within its walls. One hundred and
two British Washerwoinen have been relieved
when in the last stage of decay. ONE HUN-
DRED Am> NINETY-Emnr THOUSAND articles

543

of male and female dress have been washed,
mended‚ buttoned, ironed, and mangled in the
Establishment. And, by an arrangement
with the governors of the Foundling, it is to
be hoped that THE BA BY-LINEN OF 'rHA'r Hos-
PITAL will be confided to the British Wash-
erwoman's Home 1

“With such prospects before it, is it not
sad, is it not lamentable to think, that the
Patronesses of the Society have been coni-
pelled to reject the applications of no less than
THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AM) oNE
Bssmsfl lVAsHERwoMEm froin l =ck of means
for their support? Ladies tf England!
Mothers of England! to you we appeal. Is
there one of you that will not respond to the
cry in behalf of these deserving member-s of
our sex ⁶?

“It has been determined by the Ladies-
Patronesses to give a fete at Benlah Spa, on
Thursday, July 25; which will be graced
with the first foreign and native TALENT; bv
the first foreign and native ΒΑΜ( ; and where
they beg for the attendance of every WAsu-
ERWOMAn’s FRIEND.''

Her Highness the Princess of Schloppen-
zollernschwigmaringen, the ane of Sacks-
Tubbingen‚ His Excellency Baron Strumpff,
His Excellency Lootf-Allee-Koolee-Bismillah-
Mohamed-Rnsheed-Allah, the Persian Am-
bassador ; Prince Futtee-Jaw, Envoy from the
King of Oude3 His Excellency Don Alonzo
di Cachachero·y-Fandango-y—Castanete, the
Spanish Ambassador; Count Ravicli, from
Milan 3 the Envoy of the Republic of T opin-
ambo, and a host of other fashionables, prom-
ised to honor the festival; and their names
made a famous show in the bills. Besides
these we had the celebrated band of Mos-
cowmusiks, the seventy·seven Transylvanian
trumpeters, and the famous Bohemian Minue-
singers; with all the leading artists of Lon-
don, Paris, the Continent, and the rest of
Europe.

Ι leave you to fancy what a splendid triumph
for the British XVasherwoman's Home was to
come off on that day. A beautiful tent was
erected, in which the Ladies-Patronesses were
to meet; it was hung round with specimens
of the skill of the washerwomen's-orphans3
