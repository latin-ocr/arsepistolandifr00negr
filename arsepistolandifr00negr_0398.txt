THE} OLD GARRISON.

HE autumn twilight was deepening into

T night 115 Beatrice Wansted reached her

home, and 1111115011, before pushing open

the swinging gato, to look at it with a strange
(11510510.

“ How can Ι go in and sit down as if noth-
ing had happened? How can Ι 5111116, and
talk, and livc day after day? How long will
it be before I break out into raving lnadness,
crazed by the cold monotony of such a life—
511011 11 life for n·1e?''

Sa whispering, she lcaned upon the mossy
111100, and stared at the old house with such
‹listasteful interest as a trappist‚ newly hidden
but not divorced fr0111 the world, might feel
for the spot where he is bid to dig his future
grave

And yet the Old Garrison‚ as Milvor called
it, was 111) 11110116611111 ‹lwelling‚ albeit vener-
able and quaint as 115 origin promised. More
than two hundred years ago—not fifty after
Beatrice Conci had expiated upon 1116 scaffold
1101 most righteous crime—a party of Puritans,
straying from the settlcnient about Plymouth
Bay, had urged their skiff up Milvor Branch,
and at its head had diverged into Millbmok,
following the bright course of its waters, until,
not far froin the mouth, they curved in a sud-
11011 bend about a pretty knoll surrounded by
rich mcadow-land. .

Here they halted, and hcre one of the party,
Peleg Barstow, by 11111116, decided to remain;
and being a godIy and just man, bestowed
such treasure of beads, gunpowdcr, 0111111, and,
it may bc, less innocent wares, upon the Indian
owners, as induced them to affix 111011· signs-
manual to a deed, yet extant in the old house,

 

by which they made over to Peleg Barstow
and his heirs forever all right and title to
knoll, meadows, upland, brook‚ and the her-
ring which crowded its merry waters, forever
and a day.

But—alas! that we should say it—not fifty
years later, Peleg and his sons found them-
selves obliged 10 fortify their dwelling against
the invasion of these same savage allies, now
become their cruel enemies3 and so success-
fully did they strengthen its defences that the
women and children for miles around flocked
to them for shelter, and the house received
the name it has since retained, and is still
known as the Old Gai-rison.

But to the few roonis of the original house
with their walls three feet in thickness, and
their leaden casements with tiny diamond-
shaped panes, came to be added, by successive
generations of Bmstows, additions of such
style and size as suited the wants or the taste
of the builders, so that the house stood finally
a sort of hieroglyphic genealogy of the raoe,
and Beatrice Wansted might have read, had
she been so minded, the story of her ancestors
in the motley architecture of the home they
had bequeathed her.

But Time has power over none but his own
dominion, and though the work of old Peleg
Barstow's hands had well-nigh mingled with
1116 dust that had once been flesh and bones
of that sturdy old Purstan, the knoll and the
brook, and human nature remained much as
they had been in his day3 and this his fair
descendant stood contemplating her home in
the gray twilight‚ with far less thought of the
past it represented, than of her own future,
