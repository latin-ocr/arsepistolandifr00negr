WILLIAM WORDSWORTH. 597

Fallings from us, vanishings; Yo that through your hearts to·day
Blank misgivings of a creature Feel the gladncss of the May! [bright
Moving about in worlds not realized, What though the radiance which was once so
High instinctS, before which our mortal nature Be now for ever taken from thy sight—
Did tremble, like a guilty thing surprised! Though nothing can bring back the honr
Of splendor in the grass, of glory in the flower ;
But f01' thOSe first affeetions, We will grieve not, rather find
ThOSO ShadOWY ΥθθΟῙῙθΟῐῘΟἨΒ, Strength in what remains behind,
‘Vhisslb be they What they may» In the primal sympathy,
ΑΓΘ 5⁰¹³ the sonutam light Of all 0¹¹1' day, thich, having been, must ever be,
Are yet a master light Of all 0¹¹? Sssssing ἶ In the soothing thoughts that spring
Uphohl us-cherish—-and have power to make Qut Of huma„ suffering,
ΟΜ ΠΟῙΘΥ years-seem momente* in the being In the saith that looks through death,
Of the eternal sssence: tfflths that wake In years that bring the philosophie mind.

To perish never ;
Which neither listlessness„ nor mad endeavor,
Nor man, nor boy,
Nor all that is at eumity with joy,
Can utterly abolish or destroy:
Hence, in a season of calm weather,

And oh, ye fountains, inoadowsdiills, and groves‚
Think not of any severing of your loves!
Yet in my beart of hearts Ι feel your might;
I only have relinquished one delight,

To live beneath your more habitu-al sway.
Though inland fur we be, Ilove the brooks,xvliieh down their channels fret,

our souls have sight Of that immortal sea Even more than when I tripped lightly as they;
xvhjch brought us pithen The innocent brightness of a new-born day
Is lovely yct;

The clouds that gather round the sctting sun

Do take a sober coloring from an eye

That hath kept watch o’er man’s mortality ;

Then, sing, ye birds, sing, sing a joyous song, Anotherracc bath been,and othcrpalnisare won

Can in a moment travel thither—
And 566 the children sport upon the shore,
And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.

And let the young lamhs bound Thanks to the human heart by which we live;
As to the tabor’s sound! Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,
We, in thought, will join your throng, To me the meanest flower that blows can give

Ye that pipe and ye that play, Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.

 

 

SHE WAS A PHANTOM ,OF DELIGHT.

HE was a phantom of delight Sweet records, promises as sweet;
XVhen first she gleamed upon my sight; A creature not too bright or good
A lovely apparition‚ sent For human nature’s daily food,
To be a moment's ornament3 For transient sorrows, simple wiles‚
Her eyes as stars of twilight fair3 Praise, blame, love,kisses, tears, and smiles.

Like twilight’s, too, her dusky hair;

. And now I see with eye serene
But all things else about her drawn

From May-time and the cheerful dawn ; ῗιξθζὲἕὺεέὲῗῖἰῖἒ ῖῗοῒὲῗὲᾜῦἐωᾶὠ,

A dancmg Shape' ³⁴¹¹ i¹¹¹age gay' A traveller between life and death:

TO haunt’ to Startle' and waylay' The reason firm, the temperate will,

I saw her upon nearer view, Endurance, foresight, strength, and skill;
A spirit, yet a woman too! A perfect woman, nobly planned

Her household motions light and free, To warn, to comfort, and command ;
And steps of virgin-liberty ; And yet a spirit still, and bright

A countenance in which did meet With something of an angel-light.
