With moulderin g bones the deeps are white,

From the ice-clad pole to the tropics bright;

The mermaid hath twisted her fingers eold

With the mesh of the sea-boy's curls of gold,

And the gods of the ocean have frowned to
see

The mariner's bed in their 1111113 of glee;

LYDIA HUNTLEY SIGOURNEY.

Ye build—ye build—but ye enter not 111,

Like the tribes whom the desert devoured in
their sin

From the land of promise ye fade and die

Ere its verdure gleams forth on your weary eye ;

As the kings of the cloud-crowned pyramid‚

Their noiseless bones in oblivion hide,

Hath earth no graves, that ye thus must Ye slumber unmarked 'mid the desolate main,

The bofirffisscsls sea for the thronging dead ⁶?

While the wonder and pride of your work
remam.

MAN—WOMAN.

AN’S home is everywhere. On ocean’s
Μ flood,
XVhere the strong ship with storm-defy-
ing tether
Doth link in stormy brotherhood
Earth's ntmost zones together,
VVhere’er the red gold glows, the spice-trees
wave‚
‘Where the rich diamond ripens, ’mid the flame
Of vertio suns that ope the stranger's grave,
He with bronzed eheek and daring step
doth rove ;
He with short paug and slight
Doth turn him from the eheekered light
Of the fair moon through his own forests
daneing,
11711616 11111310, joy, and love
&Vere 1113 young 1101113 entrancing;
And where ambition's thunder-olaim
Ρο11113 0111 1113 101,
Or fitful wealth allures to roam,
There doth 116 make 1113 1101116,
Repining not.

 

It is not thus with Womaoz. The far halls,
Though ruinous and 10116,
VVhere first her pleased ear drank a nursing—
mother's tone ;
The home with humble walls,

WVhere breathed a parent’s prayer around her
bed ;
The valley where, with playmates true,
She culled the strawberry, bright with
dew ;
The bower where Love her timid footsteps
The helziiiitlistone where her children grew;
The (lamp soil where she east
The1flower-seeds of her hope, and saw them
bide the blast,—
Affection with unfading tint recalls‚
Lingering round the ivied walls,
11711616 every rose hath in its cup a bee,
Making fresh honey of remembered things,
Eaeh rose without a thorn, each bee bereft of
stings.

THE EA RLY BLUEBIRD.

LUEBIRD! on yon leafless tree
Dos-t thou carol 111113 10 1116 :
“Spring 13 coming! Spring 13 11616 ! ''
Sayest thou so, my birdie deur?
What 13 that, in misty 31111 uid,
8161111116,Γ from 1110 darkened cloud?
Lo! 1110 snow-ssakes’ gathoring monnd
Sottles o'er the whitened ground,
Yet 111011 singest, blithe and clear:
‘¹ Spriug 13 001116 ! Spring 13 here! ”

Str-ihest thou not too bold a strain?
Winds are piping o'er the plain ;
Clouds are sweeping o'er the sky
With a blaek and threatening eye:
Urchius, by the frozen rill,

WVrap 111611· 1116111163 010361· 31111;
Yon poor man, with doublet old,
Doth he shiver at the oold?

Hath he not a nose of blue?

Tell me, birdling, tell me true.
