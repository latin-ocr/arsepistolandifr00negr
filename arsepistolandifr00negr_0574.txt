526 SIR WALTER SCOTT.

words, in the gesture—everything in the very faces of the personages
called up before us, speaks of times of energetic voliti0n÷uneontrolled >
action, disturbance, tumult—the storms and whirlwinds of restless souls J
and ungoverned passions. It seems as if the atmosphere around them -
were all alive with the breath of trumpets, and the neighing of chargers,
and the echo of war-cries. And yet, with a true and beautiful skilfulness,
the author has rested the main interest of his Story, not upon these fiery
exter11als,in themselves so full of attraction, and every way so charae-³-
teristic of the age to which the story refers, but on the workings of that
most poetical of passions which is ever deepest where it is most calm, ·,
quiet, and delicate, and which, less than any other is changed, even in its
modes of manifestation, in conformity with the changes of time, manners, ᾗ
311(1 circumstances. .

For the true interest of this romance of the days of Richard is placed
neither in Richard himself, nor in the Knight of Ivanhoe, the nominal ’
1161ος 1101 111 any of the haughty Templars or barons who occupy along ⁷
with them, the front of the scene, but in the still, devoted, sad, and unre-
quited teuderness of a Jewish damsel-—by far the most fine, and at the
same time most romantic creation of female character the author has ever
formed—and second, we suspect, to none that is to be found in the whole
annals of poetry and 1011131166.

Β651(165 writing his novels, Sir Walter Scott edited various works, ,
and produced some volumes of history, and a life of “Napoleon Bona-
parte,'' to which, however, his party prej udices and hurried composition
prevented him from doing justice. The failure of his bookseller, an
unforeseen missortune, darkened the close of Sir XValter’s life by pecu-
niary embarrassment. His health suffered by the assiduity with which
he labored to relieve his fortunes. Shocks of paralysis warned him of his
approaching fate, and, after having travelled without benefit to his health,
this trnly great and good man died at his seat at Abbotsford‚ in the year ’-
1832.

The very name of Sir Walter 86011 strikes a responsive chord in
almost every breast, for few are the persons who have not been charmed
and delighted with the “ NVaverly Novels'’ and his sprightly, spirited 3
poenis. His name is the chief ornament of Scottish literature, and such =
15 1116 character of his works that they 6311 perish only with the language.

of charming romance, in skilful weaving of the plot, and in photograph-
