Tyrant and slave are swept away,

Less formed to wear before the ray;
But that white veil, the lightest, frailest,
Which on the mighty mount thou hailest,
While tower and tree are torn and rent,
Shines o'er its eraggy battlement,

In form a peak, in height a cloud,

In texture like a. hovering shroud,

Thus high by parting Freedom spread,
As from her fond abode she fied,

And lingered 011 the spot where long
Her prophet spirit spake in song.
