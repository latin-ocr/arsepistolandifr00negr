KATHIE MORRIS.

H! fineit was that April time, when gentle
Α winds were blowing,
To hunt for pale arbutus-blooms that
hide beneath the leaves,
To hear the merry rain come down, and see
the clover growing,
And wateh the airy swallows as they darted
round the eaves 1

You wonder why I dream to-night of clover
that was growing
So many years ago, my wife, when we were
in our prime 3
Fo· ‚ hark1 the wind is in the flue, and
J ohnny says 'tis snowing,
And through the storm the elanging bells
ring in the Chi-istmas time.

Ι cannot tell, but something sweet about my
beart is clfflging,
A vision and a memory—'tis little that I
mind
The weary wintry weather, for Ι hear the
robins singing,
And the petals of the apple-blooms are ruf-
fied in the wind 1

It was a sunny morn in May, and in the
fragrant meadow
1 lay, and dreamed of one fair face, as fair
and fresh as Spring:

Would Kathie Morris love me? Then in
sunshine and in shadow
I built up loft castles on a golden wedding-
ring.

Oh sweet it was to dream of her, the soldier’s
only daughter,
The pretty pious Puritan‚ that flirted so
with Will;
The music of her winsome mouth was like the
laughing water
That broke in silvery syllables by Farmer
Philip's mill.

And Will had gone away to sea: he did not
leave her grieving ;
Her bonny heart was not for him, so reck-
less and so vain ;
And Will turned out a buceaneer, and hanged
was he for thieving,
And scuttling helpless ships that sailed
across the Spanish main.

And I had come to grief for her, the scornful
village beauty,
For, oh, she had a witty tongue could cut
you like a knife;
She scanned me with her handsome eyeS‚ and
I, in bounden duty,

Did love her—loved her more for that, and ’

wearied of my life.
