American Humorist.

 

4 ⁷* i , ³ NCE it would not have been predicted that American literature
⁴ ¹ ⁸ would ever include a class of professional humorists. Before
J fif, ,ξε the advent of those who make it a business to excite the laugh-
13Ῑᾷ ⁴2³¹) ter of the public there were writers whose exquisite humor was
’ fully acknowledged and appreciated. Who that has ever read

are “The Jumping Frog'' (1867), “ The Innocents Abroad ’³ (1869),

Pauper'’ (1882), and “Life on the Mississippi’' (1883). The story and
