JOHN POERPONT.
Author of '“Airs of palestine.''

. stately movement, scholarly finish and elevated sentiment,
Ι Rev. John Pierpont's poems excel and are an important part of
,, our poetical treasures.

The author of the “Airs of Palestine,‘' is a native of Litch-
field, Connecticut, aud was born on the sixth of April, 1785.
His great-grandfather, the Reverend James Pierpont, was the
second minister of New Haven, and one of the founders of Yale College3
his grandfather and his father were men of intelligence and integrity3
and his mother, whose maiden name was Elizabeth Collins, had a mind
thoroughly imbued with the religious sentiment, and was distinguished
for her devotion to maternal duties. In the following lines, from one of
his poems, he acknowledges the influence of her example and teachings

on his own character:

“She led me first to God ;

Her words and prayers were my young spirit's dew.
For, when she used to leave
The fireside, every eve,

Ι knew it was for prayer that she withdrew.

 

“ That dew, that blessed my youth,—
Her holy love, her truth,
Her spirit of devotion, and the tears
That she could not suppress,—
Hath never ceased to bless
My soul, nor will it, through eternal years.”

Mr. Pierpont graduated at Yale College in 1804, and afterward studied
law, which, however, he soon abandoned. In 1816 the publication of his
“ Airs of Palestine ‘' gave him wide reputation, yet he did not enter upon
authorship as a profession. He studied theology at Harvard and in 1819
was ordained pastor of the Hollis Street Church, Boston. ln 18 3 5 he
made the tour of Europe, also visiting Greece and Asia Minor. He was
a prominent advocate of reforms, including temperance and anti-slavery.

In 1845 he became minister of the Unitarian Church of Medford.
