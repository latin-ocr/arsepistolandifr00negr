A GORN-HUSKING IN SOUTH CAROLINA.

In his work entitled, “ The Letters of a Traveler,” we find a passage that well illustrates

Mr. Bryant’s descript-ive powers and his habit of close observation.

He describes a corn-

husking, in which the rollicking humor, grotesque songs and speeches of the colored peo-
ple afforded him much amusement. The company at a husking was usually divided into
two parties, and a prize was offered to the party that finished husking its pile of corn
before its competitor. Mr. Byant thus describes one of these novel husking-bees :

UT you must hear of the corn-shucking. J

The one at which I was present was

given on purpose that I might witness
the humors of the Carolina negroes. A huge
tire of lith—wood was made near the corn-
house. Light-wood is the wood of the long-
leaved pine, and is so called, not because it is
light, for it is almost the heaviest wood in the
world, but because it gives more light than
any other fuel.

The light wood-tire was made, and the
negroes dropped in from the neighboring
plantations‚ singing as they came. The 1
driver of the plantation, a colored mam}
brought out baskets of corn in the husk‚ and ζ
piled it in a heap; and the negrces began to
strip the husks from the eam, singing with
great glee as they worked, keeping time to the A
music, and now and then throwing in a joke
and an extravagant burst of laughter. The
songs were generally of a comic character;
but one of them was set to a singularly wild
and plaintive air, wlsich some of our musicians
would do well to reduce to notation. These
are the words:

J ohnny come down de hollow.

 

Oh hollow !
Johnny come down de hollow.

Oh hollow !
De nigger-trader got me.

Oh hollow 1
De speculator bought me.

Oh hollow!
I'm sold for silver dollars.

Oh hollow l
Boys, go catch the pony.

Oh hollow l
Bring him round the corner.

Oh hollow!

I’m going away to Georgia.
Oh hollow 1

Boys, good-by forever!
Oh hollow!

The song of “ Jenny gone away ’' was also
given, and another, called the monkey-song,
probably of African origin, in which the prin-
cipal singer personated a monkey, with all
sorts of gesticulations‚ and the other negroes
bore part in the chorus, ‘⁴ Dan, dan, who's the
dandy?'' One of the songs commonly sung
on these occasions represents the various ani-
mals of the woods as belonging to some pro-
fession or trade. For example-—

De cooter is de boatman—

The cooter is the terrapin, and a very expett
boatman he is.

De cooter is de boatman.
John John Crow.

De red—bird de soger.
John John Crow.

De mocking-bird de lawyer.
John John Crow.

De alligator sawyer.
John John Crow.

The alligator’s back is furnished with a

Ἰ toothed ridge‚ like the edge of a saw, which

explains the last line.

When the work of the evening was over the
negroes adjourned to a spacious kitchen. One
of them took his place as musician, whistling,
and beating time with two sticks upon the
floor. Several of the men came forward and
executed various dances, capering, prancing,
and drumming with heel and toe upon the
floor, with astonishing agility and persever-
ance, though all of them had performed their
daily tasks and had worked all the evening,
and some had walked from four to seven
miles to attend the corn-shucking.

From the dances a transition was made to a
mock military parade, a sort of burlesque of
our military trainingS‚ in which the words of
