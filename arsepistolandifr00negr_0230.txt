ABRAHAM LlNCoLN.
Our First Martyred president.

 

J MN*— EXT to the name of Washington none stands higher on the roll '
(Q Χ of illustrious Americans than that of Abraham Lincoln. ’
(ἓξὲξ, 1ndeed, the sixteenth president of the United States‚ the skill- ⁴
&wi ff ful pilot who guided our ship of state through the stormy
