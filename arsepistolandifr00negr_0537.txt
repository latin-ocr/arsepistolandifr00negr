And how, when one by one sweet sounds and
wandering lights departed,

He wore no less a loving face because so
broken-hearted.

He shall be strong to sanctify the poet’s high
Vocati0n‚
And bow the meekest Christian down in

meeker adoration ;
Nor ever shall he be in praise by wise 01 good

forsaken;
Named softly as the household name of one
whom God hath taken.

With quiet sadness and no gloom Ι learned to
think upon him,
With meekness that is gratefulness to Grod

whose heaven hath won him,
Who suffered once the madness-cloud to his

own love to blind him,
But gently led the blind along where breath
and bird could find him ;

And wrought within his shattered brain such

quick poetic senses
As hills have language for, and stars har-

monious infiuences:

The pulse of dew upon the grass kept 1115
within its number,

And silent shadows from the trees refreshed

But though, in blindness, he remained uncon-
scious of that guiding‚

sense of providing,

He testified to this solemn truth, while frenzy-

THE SLEEP.

‘⁶ He giveth his beloved sleep.”—PSALM cxxvii. 2.

F all the thoughts of God that are
Borne inward unto souls afar,
Along the Palmist’s music deep,
Now tell me if that any is,
For gift or grace, surpassing this,—
“ He giveth his beloved sleep! ''

The hero’s heart to be unmoved,

The poet's star-tuned harp to sweep,
The patriot's voice to teach and rouse,
The monarch's crown to light the 11101115,-
