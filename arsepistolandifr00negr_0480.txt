Ι saw him again on the other side,

But his silk gown floated 011 the tide3

And no one asked, in that blissfnl spot,
&Vliether he belonged to the “ Church ’' or not.

Thon down to the river 11 Quaker strayed ;
His dress of a sober hue was made :

“ Mv coat and hat must 311 119 gray—-

I en'nnot go any other way.'’

Then he buttoned his 90111 straight up to his
chin,

And staidly, solemnly. waded in,

And his broad-hrininied hat he pulled down
tight,

Over his forehead 30 cold and white.

But 11 strong wind carried away his hat;
A moment he silently sighed over that;
And then, as he gazed to the further shore,
The coat slipped off, and was seen no more.

As he entered heaven his suit of gray
Went quietly, sailing, away, away3
And none of 1119 angels questioned him
About the width of his beaver‘s brim.

Next came Dr. XVatts. with 11 bundle of psalms
'fied nicely up in his aged arms,

And hymns 113 many, a very wise thing,

'sliat the people in heaven, “all round‚’' might

sing.

Bnt Ι thought that he heaved an anxious sigh,
And he saw that the river ran broad and high,
And looked rather surprised, as one by one

The psalms and hymns in the wave went down.

And aster him, with his MSS„
Came XVesley, the pattern of godliness;
But he cried, ·‘ Dear me! what shall I do?

The water has soaked them through and
throngh.’‘

And there on the river sar and wide,

Away they went down the swollen tide;

And the saint,astonished, passed through alone,
Without his manuscripts, np to the throne.

Then, gravely walking, two saints by name
Down to 1119 stream together came ;

But, 113 they stopped at the river's brink,

I saw one saint froin the other shrink.

FAVORITE POEMS AND PROSE SELECTIONS.

· A Presbyter-ian Church went down;

’γ But the men Ι could count as they passed along.

Ι “ Sprinkled or plunged? may I ask you, friend,
How yon attained to life's great end ? '³
“ Thus, with a. few drops ou my brow.”

³ “ Bnt I have been dipped, as you'll see me now.

“ And I really think it will hardly do,

As l'ni ‘ close coinmunion‚' to cross with you;
Yon‘re bound, I know, to the realms of bliss,
But you 1111131 go that way, and I'll go this.’' ,

   

Τ11911 straightway plunging with all his might,
Away to the left—his friend to the right,

Apart they went from this world of sin,
But at last together they entered in. ·

And now when the river was rolling on,

Of women there seemed an innumerable throng,

And concerning 1119 road, they could never
{io-ree

The old 31· 1119 new way, which it could be,

Nor ever a moment paused to think

That both would lead to the river’s brink.

And 11 sound of murmuring, long and lond,
Came ever up from the moving crowd ;

’ “Υο111·’1·9 in the old way, and I’m in the
new:

1 Τ1131 is the false, and this is the true ’'—
; Or, “I’m in the old way, and you'rein the

 

new;
Thai is the false, and this is the true.”

But the brethren only seemed to speak;
Modest the sisters walked and meek,
And if ever one of them chanced to say
that troubles she met with on the way,

ι How she longed to pass to the other side,
Nor feared to cross over the swelling tide,

A voice arose from the brethren then,

“ Let no one speak but the ⁴ holy men 3’
For have ye not heard the words of Paul,
‘ Oh, let the women keep silence all? ' ’'

I watched them long in my curious dream,
Till they stood by the borders of the stream :
Then, just 33 Ι thought, the two ways met;
But all the brethren were talking yet,
And would talk 011 till the heaving tide

ι Carried them over side by side—-
