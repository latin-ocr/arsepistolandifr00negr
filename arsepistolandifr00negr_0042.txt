24 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW. “
THE SKELETON IN ARMOR.

During some excavations at Fall River, Massaehusetts‚ the workmen came upon a
mail-elad skeleton. This suggested the following poem, which is associated with tradi-

( ζ ΡΕΑΚ 1 speakl thou fearful guest ! O'er the dark I sea fiew

tho‚ with thy hollow breast
Still in rude armor drest,
Comest to daunt me!

With the marauders.
Wild was the life we led ; <

Many the souls that sped,

ἲνηηη not in eastern balms,

But with thy fleshless palms

Stretehed, as if asking alms,
Why (lost thou haunt me? ’'

Then from those cavernous eyes

Pale flashes seem to rise‚

As when the northern skies
Gleam in Deee111ber;

And, like the waters flow

Under December-‘s snow,

Came. a dull voice of woe
From the heart’s chamber.

‘¹ Ι was a Viking old I
My ‹leeds, though lnailifold,
No Skald in song has told,

No Saga taught thee!
Take heed, that in thy verse
Thou dost the tale rehearse,
Else dread a dead man's curse!

For this I sought thee.

“ Fur in the northern land,
By the wild Baltic's strand,

I, with my childish hand,
Tamed the ger-falcon ;
And, with my skates fast-bound,
Skimmed the half-frozen sound,

That the poor whimpering hound
Trembled to wall< on.

“ Oft to his frozen lair
Tracked I the grisly bear,

thile from my path the hare

Fled like a shadow ;
Ost through the forest dark
Followed the were-wolf s bark,
Until the soaring lark

San g from the meadow.

“ But when I older grew,
Joining a oorsair’s orew‚

 

Many the hearts that bled,
By our stern orders.

‘⁴ Many a wassaiLbout
XVore the long winter 0ut;
Often our midnight shout
Set the eocks erowing,
As we the Beserk's tale
Measured in eups of ale,
Draining the oaken pail,
Filled to o'erflowing.

‘¹ Once as Ι told in glee
Tales of the stormy sea,
Soft eyes did gaze on me,
Burning yet tender;
And as the white stars shine
On the dark Norway pine,
On that dark heart of mine
Fell their soft splendor.

“ Ι wooed the blue—oyed maid,
Yielding, yet half afraid,
And in the forest‘s shade

Our vows were plighted.
Under its loosened vest
Fluttered her little breast,

Like birds within their nest
By the hawk frighted.

⁴⁴ Bright in her father's hall

Shields gleamed upon the wall,

Loud sang the minstrels all,
Chaunting his glory:

When of old Hildebrand

Ι asked his daughter's hand,

Mute did the minstrels stand
To hear my story.

“ While the brown ale he quaffed,
Loud then the champion laughed‚

And as the wind gusts wast
The sea-foam brightly‚
