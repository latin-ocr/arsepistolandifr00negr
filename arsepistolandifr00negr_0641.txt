WILLIAM COW PER.

So thou, with sails how swist! hast reached
the shore

’ “ Where tempests never beat nor billows
roar:”

And thy loved consort on the dangerous tide

Of life long since has anchored by thy side.

But me, scarce hoping to attain that rest,

Always from port withheld, always distressed,—

Me howling blasts drive devious, tempest-
tossed‚

Sails ripped, seams opening wide, and com-
pass lost ;

And day by day some current's thwartin g force

Sets me more distant from a prosperous course.

Yet O. the thought that thou art safe, and
he!—

That thought is joy, arrive what may to me.

My boast is not that Ι (16(11106 my birth
From lions enthroned, and rulers of the
But higligrlhfar my proud pretensions riser—
The son of parents passed into the skies.

And now, farewelll—Time‚ unrevoked, hus
His wofflgld course ; yet what I wished is done.
By contemplation's help, not sought in vain,
I seem tohave lived my childhood o'er again,—
To have renewed the joys that once were

And, while the wings of fancy still are free,
And I can view this mimic show of thee,
Time has but half succeeded in his thest—

Thyself removed, thy power to soothe me left.

 

THE GRIOKET.

ITTLE inmate, full of mirth‚
Chirping on my kitchen hearth,
theresoe'er be thine abode

Always harbinger of good,

Pay me for thy warm retreat
With song more soft and sweet;
In return thou shalt receive
Such a strain as I can give.

Thus thy praise shall be expressed‚
Inoffensive, wele-ome guest!
While the rat is on the scout,
And the mouse with curious snout,

 

With what vermin else infest
Every dish and spoil the best ;
Frisking thus before the fire,
Thou hast all thy heart's desire.

Though in voice and shape they be
Formed as if a kin to thee.

Thou surpassest, happier far,
Happiest grasshoppers that are ;
Theirs is but a summer's song,-
Thine endures the winter long,
Unimpaired and shrill and clear,
Melody throughout the year.

THE: HAPPY MAN.

FROM “THE WINTER WALK AT NOON.”

E is the happy man whose life even now 1 The world o'erlooks him in her busy search

Shows somewhat of that happier life to

come ;
who, doomed to an obscure but tranquil state,
Is pleased with it, and, were he free to choose,

- Would make his fate his choice; whom peace,

the fruit
Of virtue, and whom virtue, fruit of faith,
Prepare for happiness; bespeak him one
Conterit indeed to sojourn while he must
Below the skies, but having there his home.
