“ ’TIS DISTANGE LENDS ENGHAN'I'MENT TO THE VIEW.''
FROM “PLEASURES OF Hom.»

T summer eve, when heaven's aerial bow More¹ pleasing seems than all the past hath
Spans with bright arch the glittering been
hills below, And every form that fancy can repair

Why to you mountain turns the musing eye, From dark oblivion‚ glows divinely there.
those sunbright summit mingles with the that potent spirit guides the raptured

sky ⁸? eye
Why do those cliffs of shadowy tint appear To pierce the shadows of dim futurity ῩἹ
More sweet than all the landscape smiling Can wisdom lend, with all her heavenly

near? 0W81' ›
’Tis distance lends enchantment to the view, The gledge of joy’s anticipated honr?
And robes the mountain in its azure hue. Ah, no ! she darkly sees the fate of man—
Thus, with delight, we linger to survey Her dim horizon pointed to a span:
The promised joys of life's unmeasured way ; Or, if she hold an image to the view,
Thus, from afar, each dim-discovered scene 'Tis nature pietured too severely true.

 

NAPOLEON AND THE SAJLOR.
A 'PRUE s'ronY.

APOLEON’S banners at Boulogne ἱ He hid it in a cave, and wrought
Armed in our island every freeman, The livelong day laborious; lurking
His navy chanced to capture one Until he launehed a tiny boat
Poor British seaman. By mighty working,
They suffered him-1 know not how— Heaven help us! ’twas a thing beyond
Unprisoned on the shore to roam ; Description wretched: such a wherry
And aye was bent his longing brow Perhaps ne'er ventured 011 a pond,
On England's home. Or crossed a ferry.
His eye, methinks, pursued the flight For ploughing in the salt sea-field,
Of birds 10 Britain 11alf.way over, It would have made the boldest shudder;
With envy, they could reach the white Untarred, uncompassed, and unkeeled,
Dear cliffs of Dover. ΝΟ sail—no ruddffl'·

A stormy midnight watch, he thought, ,From neighboring woods he interlaeed
Than this sojourn would have been dearer‚ His sorry-skiff with wattled willows3
If but the storm his vessel brought And thus Oqtlipped he would have passed

To England nearer. The foaming billows-

But Frenehmen caught him on the beach,
His little Argo sorely jeering;

Till tidings of him chanced to reaeh
Napoleon's hearing.

At last, when care had banished sleep,

He saw one morning—dreaming—-doating.
An empty hogshead from the deep

Come shoreward floating3
