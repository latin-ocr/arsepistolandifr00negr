523& GEORGE HENRY BOKER.

God's mercy! from her sloping roof
The iron tempest glanced,

As hail bounds from a cottage-thatch,
And round her leaped and danced 3

Or when against her dusky hull
We struck a fair, full blow,

The mighty, solid iron globes
&Vere crumbled up like snow.

On, on, with fast increasing speed,
The silent monster came,

Though all our starboard battery
Was one long line of flame.

She heeded not ; no guns she fired ;
straight on our bows she bore:

Through riving plank and crashing frame
Her furious way she tore.

Alas! our beautiful, keen bow,
That in the fiercest blast

So gently folded back the seas,
They hardly felt we passed.

Alas! alas! my Cumberland,
That ne’er knew grief before,

To be so gored, to feel so deep
The tusk of that sea-boar!

Once more she backward drew apace ;
Once more our side she rent,

Then, in the wantonness of hate,
Her broadside through us sent.

The dead and dying round us lay,
But our foeman lay abeam ;

Her open port-holes maddened us,
We fired with shout and seream.

We felt our vessel settling fast;
We knew our time was brief ;
‘¹ Ho 1 man the pumps!’' But they who worked
And fought not, wept with grief.

From captain down to powder-boy‚
No hand was idle then ε

Two soldiers, but by chance aboard,
Fought on like sailor men.

And when a gun's crew lost a hand,
Some bold marine stepped out,

And jerked his braided jacket off,
And hauled the gun about.

“ Up to the epar deck! save yourselves ! ”

Our forward magazine was drowned‚
And up from the sick-bay

Crawled out the wounded, red with blood,
And round us gasping lay ;—

Yes, cheering, calling us by name,
Struggling with failing breath
To keep their shipmates at the post
Where glory strove with death.

With decks afloat and powder gone,
The last broadside we gave

From the guns' heated iron lips
Burst out beneath the wave·

So sponges, rammers, and handspikes—
As men-of-war’s men should-

We placed within their proper racks,
And at our quarters stood.

Cried Selfridge. “ Up, my men!
God grant that some of us may live
To fight yon ship again! '’

We turned: we did not like to go;
Yet staying seemed but vain,

Knee-deep in water ; so we left3
Some swore, some groaned with pain. ἶ

We reached the deck. There Randall stood:
“ Another turn, men—so ! ''

Calmly he aimed his pivot gun:
“ Now, Tenny, let her go! '’

 

It did our sore hearts good to hear
The song our pivot sang,

As rushing on from wave to wave
The whirring boinb-shell sprang.

Brave Randall leaped upon the gun,
And waved his cap in sport;

“ Well done! well aimed! I saw that shell

Go through an open port!'’

It was our last, our deadliest shot3
The deck was overflown ;

The poor ship staggered‚ lurched to port,
And gave a living groan.

Down, down, as headlong through the waves
Our gallant vessel rushed;

A thousand gurgling watery sounds
Around my senses gushed.
