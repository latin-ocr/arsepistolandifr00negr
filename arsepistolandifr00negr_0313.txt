PLEA FOR HOME PROTEGTION.
DELIVERED AT A coNVENTION IN LomsvniLa KENTUCKY.

ROTECTION must be administered
through a mighty executive force and
we call that force a party. Happily

for us, what was our earnest expectation last
year, is our realization to-day‚ 'she Prohi-
bition Home Protection Party stands forth
as woman's answered prayer. In the great
convention of last August 31 Chicago, where
three hundred and forty-one delegates rep-
resented twenty-two states, where North and
south clasped hands in a union never to be
broken, we felt that the 111-316 111611 who there

will serve the cause of constitutional amend-

Southern statesman, whose biography Ι have
read in the “Gourier-Journal,” since coming
here: “He never questions the motives of
men. He always argues the mel-its of the
case.’' As the great general said to the boat-
man, so the temperance cause is saying here to
us, “ Remember you carry Caesar and his for-
tunes.” God grant that we may be so wise
and gentle that the cause we love shall not
be wounded in the house of its friends.

“ We have no time to waste,
In critic's sneer or cynic's bark‚
