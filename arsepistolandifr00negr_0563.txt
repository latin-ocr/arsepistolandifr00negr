CHARLES DICKENS. 515

name Pickwick‚ or Noakes, or Stoakes, 01·
Stiles, or Brown, or Thompson.

I shall show you, gentlemen, that for two
years Pickwick continued to reside constantly‚
and without interruption 01· 1111611111551011, at
Mrs. Bardell’s house. I shall show you that
Mrs. BardelL during the whole of that time,
waited on him, attended to his comforts,
cooked his nieals, looked out his linen for the
washer-woman, when it went abroad, durned,
aired, and prepared it for wear when it came
home, and,in short, enjoyed his fullest trust
and confidence.

 

Ι shall show you that, 011 many occasions.
he gave half-peuce, and on some occasions
even sixpence, to her little boy; and shall
prove to you, by a witness whose testimony it
will be impossible for niy learned friend to
weaken or controvert, that on one occasion he
patted the boy on the head, and after inquir-
ing whether he had won any olley toi-s or
commoneys lately (both of which I under-
stand to be species of nial-bles much 111-111611 hy
the youth of this town), made use of this
remarkable expression--“ How would you
like to have another father ’Β ”

THE. IVY GREE'N.

a dainty plant is the ivy green,
T hat creepeth o'er ruins old !

OH!

And slily he traileth along the ground,
And his leaves he gently waveS,

On right choice food are his meals, Ι Α5 116 joyously hugs and crawleth round

ween,
In his cell so lone and cold.
The wall must be crumbled, 1116 stone decayed,
To pleasure his dainty whim ;
And the mouldering (lust that years have
made,
Is a merry inea] for him.
Creeping where no life is 56611,
A rare old plant is the ivy green.

Fast he stealeth 011 though he wears no wiugs,
And a staunch old heart has he ;

How closely he twineth, how close he clings,
To his friend the huge oak tree!

The rich mould of dead men's graves.
Creeping where grin] death has been,
A rare old plant is the ivy green.

Whole ages have fied, and their works decayed‚
And nations have scattered been ;
But the stout old ivy shall never sade
From its hale and hearty green.
The brave old plant 111 its lonel y days
Shall fittten on the past :
For the strateliest building man cau raise
Is the ivy's food at last.
Creeping on where time has been,
A rare old 11111111, is the ivy green!
