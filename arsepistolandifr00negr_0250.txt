202 HARRIET BEECHER STOWE.

showing a lamentable misunderstanding of the true situation, but which
Mrs. Stowe very properly and ably answered in her “ Reply on behalf of
the Women of America.''

In 1869 appeared “ Oldtown Folks,’' presenting, among other things,
a masterly picture of the phases of religious thought and feeling in New
England during the preceding century. Unfortunately she was drawn
into a controversy, in 1868, occasioned by the publication of a work en-
titled, “ My Recollections of Lord Byron, and those of Eye-Witnesses of
His Life.” This was issued without a name, but was supposed to have
been written by the Countess Guiccioli‚ which contained severe reflections
on the character of the Lady Byron. Partly in reply to these, Mrs. Stowe
wrote the “ True Story of Lord Byron’s Life‚'' published in 1869 in the
“ Atlantic Monthly.'' This was severely criticised in American and
European journals.

Among MrS. Stowe‘s later books are “ Pink and White Tyranny‚'’
issued in 1871 3 “My Wife and 1‚“ in 1882 ; “ Palmetto Leaves,'' in 18733 ,54
“ Betty's Bright Idea‚'' 1876, and “ Footprints of the Master‚'‘ 1877. For
many years Mrs. Stowe resided in Hartford in the centre of one of the
most cultured literary circles of our country. She died July Ist, 1896.
