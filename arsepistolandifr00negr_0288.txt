Orator and Statesman.

 

ᾗ R. DEPEW is a man of broad and liberal education. He was
V born in Peekskill, N. Y„ April 23, 1834. Even in his boy-
, hood he was a gifted declaimer, and gave prophecy then of his
.-' ³ “⁷ distinguished career as an orator. The old saying that “the
boy is the father to the man ‘' is illustrated in his case. He
graduated from Yale College in 18 56, having taken high rank
during his course, especially in the department of rhetoric and oratory.
Many were the contests he had in college, and many were the times that
he emerged from them with complete success. His socia] disposition, his
breezy manner, his happy knack of merry-making and his fund of anec-
dote, rendered him a general favorite.

In 1858 he began practicing law, considering that this profession
furnished the widest opportunities for such abilities as he could command.
His public career as an orator was begun in 1856 in the Fremont cam-
paign. He became widely known throughout the eastern part of New
York for his pithy and eloquent stump—speeches, and very soon found
himself in favor with the older leaders of the party. His youth, his self-
possession, his fiuency, his grasp of the subj ects he treated, his unbounded
enthusiasm, drew immediate attention and marked a coming man. As
an after-dinner speaker Mr. Depew has always been considered without a

rival.
In 1861 he was sent to the Legislature of New York, and two years

later he was elected Secretary of State, declining a re-election two years
subsequently. He found it necessary to devote his time somewhat exclu-
sively to his profession, considering that this was his legitimate calling,
and to pursue it would prove of lasting benefit to him in the end. In

 

1866 he was chosen attorney for the New York and Harlem Railroad, -
and, three years later, when the railroad was consolidated with the New ·

York Central, he became general counsel of the company. He was
elected second Vice-President of the Central Railroad in 1882, and the

following year President of the ‘⁴ Vanderbilt roads.''
