ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE.

The faint fresh flame of the young year flushes
From leaf to flower and flower to fruit;
Α1111 fruit and leaf are as gold and 1110,
And the 0111 15 heard above the lyre,
And the heofed heel of a satyr erushes
The ehest-nut-husk at 1110 0110511101-1001,

And Pan by noon and Bacchus by night,
Flecter of foot than the fleet foot kid,
Follows with daneing and filis with delight

The Maenad aud the Bassarid;
And soft 115 lips that laugh and hide,
The laughing leaves of 1110 trees divide,
And 5010011 froin seeiug and leave in sight
The god pursuing, the maiden hid.

The ivy fulls with 1110 Baaehanal's hair

0101· hei· eyebrows shading her eyes;
The 111111 vine slipping down leaves bare

Her bright hreast shortening iuto sighs;
The 111111 11110 slips with the weight of its

leaves,

But the berried ivy eatehes and eleaves
To the 11111115 111111 glitten the feet that seare
The wolf that follows, the fawn that flies.

BABY'S FEET.

It may be said without question that English poetry can furnish few gems so delicate and
captivating 115 these exquisite lines. They are more than faneiful; they are tender, beautiful

and full of meaning.

BABY’S feet, like sea-shell pink,
Mi ght teinpt, should Heaven see meet,
As angel's lips 10 kiss, we think,
A baby’s feet.

Like rose-hued sea flowers toward the heat
They streteh and spread and wink

Their ten soft buds that part and meet,
On baby’s feet.

N 0 fiower bells that exp-and and shrink
Gleam half so heavenly sweet

As shine on life's untrodden brink,
A baby's feet.

THE DISAPPOINTED LOVER..

WILL go back to the great sweet niother— O fair green-girdled mother of mine,
Ι Sea, that art elothed with the sun and the

Mother and lover of men, the sea.
Ι will go down 10 1101, Ι and none other,
Close with her, kiss her, and mix her with
me,
Cling to her, strive with her, hold her fast.
O fair white mother, in days long past
Born without sister, born without brother,
Set free my seul as thy soul is free.

Thy sweet hard kisses are strong like wine,
Thy large embraees are keen like pain.
Save me and hide me with all thy waves,
Find me one grave of thy thousand graves,
These pure eold populous graves of thine—

Wrought without hand in a world without

stain.
