32 WiLLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.

marked the period of Jefferson's administration, he wrote “ The Embargo,'’
a political satire, which was printed in Boston in 1808.

Tasso, when nine years of age, wrote some lines to his mother which
have been praised. Cowley at ten finished his “ Tragical History of
Pyramus and T hisbe;'’ Pope when twelve his “Ode to Solitud'e;'' and
“the wondrous boy Chatterton,'’ at the same age, some verses entitled “A
Hymn for Christmas Day 3 ’' but none of these pieces are superior to that
which gave a title to the volume of our precocious American. The satire
was directed against President Jefferson and his party. The description
of a caucus, in the following extract, shows that there has been little
change in the character of such assemblies, and it will be confessed that
the lines are remarkably spirited and graphic for so young an author:

“ Oh, might some patriot rise, the gloom dispel,
Chase Error's mist, and break her magio spe]l;
But vain the wish, for, hark! the murmuring meed
Of hoarse applause from yonder shed proeeed ;
Enter, and view the thronging concourse there,
Intent, with gaping mouth and stupid stare;
While, in the midst, their supple leader stands,
Harangues aloud, and flourishes his hands;
To adulatiou tunes his servile throat,
And sues, successful, for each blockhead’s vote.''

‘In the sixteenth year of his age Bryant entered an advanced class of
Williams College, in which he soon became distinguished for his attain-
nients generally, and especially for his proficiency iu Classical learning.
He appears, however, to have had little taste for the drudgery of college
life, and having obtained an honorable discharge from the faculty, he
studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1815. He located at Great
Barrington, Mass, where he was soon afterward married.

When but little more than eighteen years of age he wrote his cele-
brated poem of “ Thanatopsis,” which many readers have always consid-
ered his best production. Very properly Bryant may be called the poet
of nature, a term which has been applied to the English poet Wordsworth,
but with no better reason than to William Cullen Bryant. This appre-
ciation of the sublime and beautiful in nature, and this love for all
outward charms of the external world, is scen in1 nearly all of his produc·
tions. For example, his grand “ Forest Hymn '' begins with these

majestic lines:
