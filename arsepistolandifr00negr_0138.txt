RAISING THE WIND.
FROM ‘⁴ THE CHAINBEARER.”

“ AAP '’—I asked of my companion, as we
drew near to the hamlet where I in-
tended to pass the night, and the comforts
of a warm supper on a sharp frosty evening
began to haunt my imagination—“ J aap‚ how
much money may you have about you ’ἐ ”
“I, Masser Mordauntl—Golly! but dat a'
berry droll question, sah ! ''
“ Ι ask, because my own stock is reduced to
just one York shilling, which goes by the
name of only a ninepence in this partos the

w rld.'’
O“Dat berry little, to tell 'e trut', sah, for

two gentleum, and two large, hungry hosses.
Berry little, indeed, sah! I wish he war’
more.''

“ Yet, I have not a copper more. Ι gave
one thousand two hundred dollars for the
dinner and baiting and oats, at noon.’'

“ Yes, sah—but, dat conternental, sah, I
supposes-no great t’ing, a'ter all.’'

“ It’s a great thing in sound, Jaap, but not
much when it comes to the teeth, as you per-
ceive. NevertheleSS‚ we must eat and drink,
and our nags must eat too——I suppose-they

mffquersljllgaliw—ssdzltlt tliffije 'ionga yah-yahss
yah '’—how easily that negro laughed !—“ But
’e cider wonderful good in dis part of ’e
country, young masser ; just needer sweet nor
sour—den he strong as ’e jackass.”

“ Well, J aap, how are we to get any of this
good cider, of which you speak ’ἰ ”

“You t’ink, sah, dis part of 'e country been
talk to much lately ’bout Patty Rism and ’e

country, sah? ”
“ I am afraid Patty has been overdone here,

as well as in most other countries.'’

I may observe here, that J aap always
imagined the beautiful creature he had heard
so much extolled, and commended for her
comeliness and virtue, was a certain young
woman of this name, with whom all Oongress
was unaccountably in love at the same time.

“ Well, den, sah, dere no hope, but our wits.
Let me be masser to-night‚ and you mind ole
Jmp, if he want good supper. Jest ride

abead, Masser Mordaunt, and give he order
like General Littlepage son, and leave it all
to ole Jaap.’'

As there was not much to choose‚ I did ride
on, and soon ceased to hear the hoofs of the
negro’s horse at my heels. I reached the inn
an hour ere J aap appeared, and was actually
seated at a capital supper before he-rode up,
as one belonging only to himself. Jaap had

taken off the Littlepage emblems, and had ,

altogether a most independent air. His horse
was stabled alongside of mine, and I soon
found that he himself was at work 011 the

remnants of my supper, as they retreated
toward the kitchen.

A traveller of my appearance was accom-
modated with the best parlour, as a matter of

“ course; and, having appeased my appetite, Ι

sat down to read some documents that were
connected with the duty I was 011. No one
could have imagined that I had only a York
shilling‚ which is a Pennsylvania “levy,” or
a Connecticut “ninepence,'' in my purse3 for
my air was that of one who could pay for all
he wanted ; the certainty that, in the long run,
my host could not be a loser, giving me a
proper degree of confidence. I had just got
through with the documents‚ and was think-
ing how I should employ the hour or two
that remained until it would be time to go to
bed, when I heard Jaap tuning his fiddle in
the bar-room. Like most negroes, the fellow
had an ear for music, and had been indulged
in his taste, until he played as well as half the
country fiddlers that were to be met.

The sound of a fiddle in a small hamlet, of

a cool October evening‚ was certain of its
result. In half an hour,the smiling landlady
came to invite me to join the company, with
the grateful information Ι should not want for
a partner, the prettiest girl in the place hav-
ing come in late, and being still unprovided
for. On entering the bar-room,I was received
with plenty of awkward bows and curtsies,
but with much simple and well-meaning
hospitality. J aap's own salutatione were very
elaborate, and altogether of a character to
