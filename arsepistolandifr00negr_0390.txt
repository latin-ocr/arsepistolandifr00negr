C C IDN'T some other things happen
D along this coast, Grandma?” asked
Ned.

“Yes, in‹leed; several things. In the XVar
of 181214 there occurred a naval battle near
Portland, between the American ship Enter-
prise and the English brig Boxer. On the
morning of the lst of September, 1813, the
Enterprise sailed from Portsmouth‚ New
Ilampshire, and on the morning of the 3d
chased the schooner suspected of being a
British privateer into Portland harbor, The
next day she left that harbor and steered
eastward, looking for British cruisers. On
the 5th they discovered in a bay what Captain
Burrows supposed to be a vessel of war getting
under way. She was a British brig, and on
sighting the Enterprise she displayed four
British ensigns‚ fired several guns as signals
to boats that had been sent ashore to return,
and, crowding canvas, bore down gallantly
for the Enterprise.

‘’Seeing that, Burrows cleared his ship for
action, sailed out a proper distance from land
to have plenty of sea room for the fight, then
shortened sail and edged for the Boxer. That
was at 3 o’clock in the asternoon. Twenty
minutes later the two brigs closed within half-

pistol shot, and both opened fire at the same
time.

“The sea was almost quiet, there was but
little wind, and that condition of things made
the cannonading very destructive. Ten min-
utes after the firing began the Enterprise
ranged ahead of the Boxer, steered across her
bows and delivered her fire with such pre-
cision and destructive energy that at 4 o’clock
the British officer in command shouted through
his trumpet that he had surrendered, but his
flag being nailed to the mast could not be
lowered until the Enterprise ceased firing.''

“ And did she, Grandma?'’ asked Ned.

“ Yes, I do not think our men ever fired on
a foe whom they believed to be ready to sur-
render. Captain Blyth of the Boxer was
already dead, having been nearly cut in two
by an eighteen—pound ball, and Captain Bur-
rows was mortally wounded. A shot struck
his thigh, causing a fatal wound. He lived
eight hours and must have suffered terrible
agony. He refused to be carried below until
the sword of the commander of the Boxer
should be brought to him. He took it eagerly
when brought, saying . ‘ Now, I am satisfied;
I die contented.’ '’

THE lesson, though a difficult one, was be perfect, and it was not. There are two

studied it in her room before school hours.
But Miss Day handed the books back with a

frown, saying, “ I told you the recitation must

laying down the slate, after glaucing over its
