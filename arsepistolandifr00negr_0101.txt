was August the third,

And quite soft were the skies ;

'hioh it might be inferred

That Ah Sin was likewise,

3t he played it that day upon William
And me in a way Ι despise.

hich we had a small game,

And Ah Sin took a hand;

was euchre-the same

He did not understand ;

1t he smiled as he sat at the table

With the smile that was childlike and bland ,

at the cards they were stoeked

In a way that Ι grieve,

1d my feelings were shoeked

At the state of Nye's sleeve,

hich was stuffed full of aces and bowers,
And the same with intent to deceive.

lt the hands that were played

By that heathen Chinee

1d the points that he made

Were quite frightful to see,

ll at last he put down a right bower,
Which the same Nye had dealt unto me.

 

Then Ι looked up at Nye,
And he gazed upon me;

And he rose with a sigh,
And said, ‘· Can this be?

We are ruined by Chincse cheap labor ! ’²
And he went for that heathen Chinee.

In the scene that ensued
I did not take a hand,

But the floor it was strewed
Like the leaves 011 the strand

With the cards that Ah Sin had been hiding
In the gaure he (lid not understand.

In his sleeves, which were long,
He had twenty-four packs‚

Which was coming it strong,
Yet Ι state but the facts;

And we found on his nails, which were taper,
What is frequent in tapers—that’s wax.

Which is why Ι remark—
And my language is plain—
That for ways that are dark,
And for tricks that are vain,
The heathen Chiuee is peculiar,
Which the same Ι 6111 free to maintain.

 

SOGIETY UPON THE STANISLAUS.

RESIDE at Table Mountain, and my name
is Truthful J ames ;
I am not up to small deceit or any sinful
games3
1d I'll tell in simple language what Ι know
about the row
161, broke up our Society upon the Stanislow. ,

[t first, Ι would remark, that it is not a pro-
per plan

»r any scientific gent to whale his fellow-man‚

1d, if a member don't agree with his peculiar
whim, ’

x lay for that same member for to “put a
head ’' on him.

>w nothing could be finer or more beautiful

to see
1611 the first six months’ proceedings of that

same Society,

 

Till Brown of Calaveras brought a lot effossi]
bones

That he found within a tunnel near the tene-
ment of J ones.

Then Brown, he read a paper, and he 166011-
strueted there,

From those same bones, an animal that was
extremely rare ;

And J ones then asked the Chair for a suspen-
sion of the rules,

Till he could prove that those same bones was
one of 1118 lost mules.

Then Brown he smiled a bitter smile, an' said
he was at fault,

It seems he had been trespassing on Jones's
family vault ;
